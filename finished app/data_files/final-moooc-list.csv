Responsive Web Design (Aquent),https://www.mooc-list.com/go.php?courseId=1110,Responsive Web Design will teach you best practices for building responsive websites that adapt to different devices and user behaviors.,"At the end of this course you’ll have a responsive portfolio website you’ve built from scratch. You will learn the essential elements of responsive web design: designing with ﬂexible grids; creating layouts which incorporate typography and fluid media; using CSS media queries; responsive web typography; the Mobile First approach; in-browser design, tools, and resources; and Responsive Web Design workﬂows.COURSE OUTLINE:- Lesson 1: What Is Responsive Web Design?An introduction to Responsive Web Design. We'll explore examples and discuss context, but you won't begin coding yet.- Lesson 2: Setting The Stage With HTML5 And CSS3You will learn the HTML5 and CSS3 syntax that is the most relevant to the sample portfolio site that is being used for the course. Coding begins in this lesson, and if you’re confident in your HTML5 and CSS3 knowledge you could skip to Chapter 3, but be aware that the structural logic of the final responsive layout begins here.- Lesson 3: Mobile FirstLearn about the Mobile First approach, which forces designers and developers to focus on the content and user experience of their websites in all contexts. This chapter involves the coding of a single column layout designed for the smartphone.- Lesson 4: CSS3 Media QueriesUnderstand how media queries are used to adjust the design and layout of a website as the viewport changes. From a coding perspective you will be adding media queries to your single column smartphone layout and setting the stage for the eventual fluid grid layout.- Lesson 5: Responsive TypographyThe heart of any website is content, and more specifically: text. This lesson discusses the challenges of managing the properties of line-height, line length, and font-size in a responsive layout. This lesson represents a deep dive into the code as you create a baseline grid and typographic scale that will serve as a foundation for your page.- Lesson 6: Using A Fluid GridLearn about the role of grid layout in web design in general and responsive layout in particular. Within the code, you will build upon your core mobile layout to create a flexible three-column design with consistent gutters.- Lesson 7: Responsive Layout: Stay FlexiblePage components such as tables and forms work well on wider desktop screens, but present challenges on the smaller screen. In this lesson you will explore how to look for solutions to common layout problems using responsive design patterns. You will get a chance to solve one particular problem as you integrate a responsive form into your existing design.- Lesson 8: Responsive ImagesLearn how to add images that work across the range of devices from the smallest phone to the largest high-definition (Retina) displays. In the coding example, you will learn a few techniques (including the Picturefill technique) that deliver the highest-quality image to your users while simultaneously avoiding performance penalties.- Lesson 9: Responsive Navigation MethodsTake a look at the unique challenges and potential solutions involved with responsive navigation. In the code, you will get a chance to create a responsive toggle menu that conserves space on smaller screens and expands to full size when possible.- Lesson 10: Optimization And PerformanceWhen you begin treating performance as another component of design such as layout or color, things fall into place. In this lesson, you will identify potential performance issues with your site using free online tools and then explore ways to optimize your assets in order to improve performance.- Lesson 11: Grid SystemsNow that you have learned how to build a responsive layout from scratch, it’s time to start looking at grid systems as a way to rapidly prototype responsive sites and/or begin using a grid system for production. You will walk through an overview of popular systems including Zurb Foundation, Twitter Bootstrap, and Gridset.- Lesson 12: Responsive Web Design WorkflowPutting it all together, this lesson compares the classic workflow of a web designer to that of someone who designs and builds responsively. Concepts, tools, and best practices will be discussed. Specifically, you will get a quick look at the benefits of using a CSS preprocessor such as Sass.",Self Paced,Self-Paced,"['Web Design', 'CSS', 'Responsive Design', 'HTML']"

Developers and the software industry are used to applications becoming faster by merely exchanging the underlying hardware. However, since the beginning of the century it has become apparent that this approach no longer works.Moore's law about the ever-increasing number of transistors per chip is still valid, but power consumption, thermal management and memory latency issues are making make serial code acceleration increasingly harder. Instead, hardware vendors now use additional transistors for multiple processing elements (‘cores’) per processor chip and deeper memory hierarchies. Modern hardware has the capability to transform any desktop, server, or even mobile system into some kind of parallel computer. This makes parallel programming the new default for application development. The exploitation of any additional horsepower from hardware is now in the responsibility of the software.The openHPI online course “Parallel Programming Concepts” presents relevant theoretical and practical foundations for parallel programming.

You will learn how to represent knowledge and how to access and benefit from semantic data on the Web.","The Web has become an object of our daily life and the amount of information in the web is ever growing. Besides plain texts, especially multimedia information such as graphics, audio or video have become a predominant part of the web's information traffic. But, how can we find useful information within this huge information space? Traditional search engines will reach the limits of their power, when it comes to understanding information content. The Semantic Web is an extension of the traditional web in the sense that information in the form of natural language text in the web will be complemented by its explicit semantics based on a formal knowledge representation. Thus, the meaning of information expressed in natural language can be accessed in an automated way and interpreted correctly, i.e. it can be understood by machines.Semantic Web technologies enable the explicit representation of knowledge and its further processing to deduce new knowledge from implicitly hidden knowledge. Thus, information access and information search will be more precise and more complete compared to today's traditional information retrieval technology. Previously heterogeneous data can be mapped and combined based on common knowledge representation and schemata easily extended in a dynamic way.More info: https://openhpi.de/course/semanticweb",Self Paced Course - Start anytime,Self-Paced,"['Web', 'Semantics', 'OWL', 'RDF', 'Microdata', 'Triple Stores']"

Creative Coding (FutureLearn),https://www.mooc-list.com/go.php?courseId=1499,"Use computer programming as a creative discipline to generate sounds, images, animations and more, with this free online course. Learning to program is no longer just for computer specialists and software developers. People from many different backgrounds now want to understand the basics of programming, because it’s both fun and an increasingly valuable skill.","One of the most exciting ways to learn programming is through authoring your own creative programs. Known as “creative coding”, this growing field uses computer software as a medium to develop original creative expression.So if you’re an artist, designer, architect or musician who’s interested in how you can expand your creative skills, or even a computer programmer looking to work in creative applications, you will find this course extremely useful.Explore the concepts and skills of creative codingThroughout the course we’ll help you develop practical programming concepts and skills by exploring creative ideas and challenges. We’ll be looking at the history and philosophy behind artistic uses of technology, so you can gain a greater understanding of how best to express your own creative vision using the software you write. The aim is to teach you “algorithmic thinking” – ways to conceptualise and model the world so you can express creative ideas using computer programs. A background in programming is not assumed or necessary.Each week we will start with a simple creative idea and guide you through turning that idea into a working computer program. We’ll be exploring programs that can generate images, animations and sound and you’ll learn how you can interact with them to change their behaviour. As you’ll discover, this opens a world of possibilities, because as you expand and modify your program new creative possibilities emerge. Starting with simple processes we will look at how to create increasingly complex and nuanced visual and sonic artworks using generative programming techniques. Assignments will give you the opportunity to explore your own creative ideas and share your achievements with fellow students.Learn with professional artists and designersWe will also look at how a number of leading professional artists and designers work creatively with computers, technology and robotics, examining their creative process and the ideas that inspire them.The course is very different from technical courses on programming. We will place creative programming in context through discussion about some of the most interesting questions raised by computer-generated art, such as:- Can a computer be independently creative?- Who is the author of a work of computer art: the programmer or the program?- How is our understanding of art and creativity changed by technology?- Does the computer bring anything that is really new to art?- If you’ve ever wondered about these questions or wanted to learn how to program a computer for creative purposes, then this course is for you.",May 1st 2017,6 Weeks,"['Computer Programs', 'Programming', 'Creativity', 'Algorithms']"

Reproducible Research (Coursera),https://www.mooc-list.com/go.php?courseId=1644,"This course focuses on the concepts and tools behind reporting modern data analyses in a reproducible manner. Reproducible research is the idea that data analyses, and more generally, scientific claims, are published with their data and software code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them. The need for reproducibility is increasing dramatically as data analyses become more complex, involving larger datasets and more sophisticated computations. Reproducibility allows for people to focus on the actual content of a data analysis, rather than on superficial details reported in a written summary.","In addition, reproducibility makes an analysis more useful to others because the data and code that actually conducted the analysis are available. This course will focus on literate statistical analysis tools which allow one to publish data analyses in a single document that allows others to easily execute the same analysis to obtain the same results. Reproducible Research is course 5 of 10 in the Data Science Specialization.Ask the right questions, manipulate data sets, and create visualizations to communicate results. This Specialization covers the concepts and tools you'll need throughout the entire data science pipeline, from asking the right kinds of questions to making inferences and publishing results.

While the base graphics system provides many important tools for visualizing data, it was part of the original R system and lacks many features that may be desirable in a plotting system, particularly when visualizing high dimensional data. The Lattice and ggplot2 systems also simplify the laying out of plots making it a much less tedious process.Graded: Week 2 QuizWEEK 3This week covers some of the workhorse statistical methods for exploratory analysis. These methods include clustering and dimension reduction techniques that allow you to make graphical displays of very high dimensional data (many many variables). We also cover novel ways to specify colors in R so that you can use color as an important and useful dimension when making data graphics. All of this material is covered in chapters 9-12 of my book Exploratory Data Analysis with R.WEEK 4This week, we'll look at two case studies in exploratory data analysis. The first involves the use of cluster analysis techniques, and the second is a more involved analysis of some air pollution data.

Process Mining: Data science in Action (Coursera),https://www.mooc-list.com/go.php?courseId=2380,"Process mining is the missing link between model-based process analysis and data-oriented analysis techniques. Through concrete data sets and easy to use software the course provides data science knowledge that can be applied directly to analyze and improve processes in a variety of domains. Data science is the profession of the future, because organizations that are unable to use (big) data in a smart way will not survive. It is not sufficient to focus on data storage and data analysis. The data scientist also needs to relate data to process analysis."," Process mining bridges the gap between traditional model-based process analysis (e.g., simulation and other business process management techniques) and data-centric analysis techniques such as machine learning and data mining. Process mining seeks the confrontation between event data (i.e., observed behavior) and process models (hand-made or discovered automatically). This technology has become available only recently, but it can be applied to any type of operational processes (organizations and systems). Example applications include: analyzing treatment processes in hospitals, improving customer service processes in a multinational, understanding the browsing behavior of customers using booking site, analyzing failures of a baggage handling system, and improving the user interface of an X-ray machine. All of these applications have in common that dynamic behavior needs to be related to process models. Hence, we refer to this as ""data science in action"".The course explains the key analysis techniques in process mining. Participants will learn various process discovery algorithms. These can be used to automatically learn process models from raw event data. Various other process analysis techniques that use event data will be presented. Moreover, the course will provide easy-to-use software, real-life data sets, and practical skills to directly apply the theory in a variety of application domains.This course starts with an overview of approaches and technologies that use event data to support decision making and business process (re)design. Then the course focuses on process mining as a bridge between data mining and business process modeling. The course is at an introductory level with various practical assignments.The course covers the three main types of process mining.The first type of process mining is discovery. A discovery technique takes an event log and produces a process model without using any a-priori information. An example is the Alpha-algorithm that takes an event log and produces a process model (a Petri net) explaining the behavior recorded in the log.The second type of process mining is conformance. Here, an existing process model is compared with an event log of the same process. Conformance checking can be used to check if reality, as recorded in the log, conforms to the model and vice versa.The third type of process mining is enhancement. Here, the idea is to extend or improve an existing process model using information about the actual process recorded in some event log. Whereas conformance checking measures the alignment between model and reality, this third type of process mining aims at changing or extending the a-priori model. An example is the extension of a process model with performance information, e.g., showing bottlenecks. Process mining techniques can be used in an offline, but also online setting. The latter is known as operational support. An example is the detection of non-conformance at the moment the deviation actually takes place. Another example is time prediction for running cases, i.e., given a partially executed case the remaining processing time is estimated based on historic information of similar cases.Process mining provides not only a bridge between data mining and business process management; it also helps to address the classical divide between ""business"" and ""IT"". Evidence-based business process management based on process mining helps to create a common ground for business process improvement and information systems development.The course uses many examples using real-life event logs to illustrate the concepts and algorithms. After taking this course, one is able to run process mining projects and have a good understanding of the Business Process Intelligence field.To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 videoWho is this class for:This course is aimed at both students and professionals.

Data Analysis (Coursera),https://www.mooc-list.com/go.php?courseId=27,Learn about the most effective data analysis methods to solve problems and achieve insight.,"You have probably heard that this is the era of “Big Data”. Stories about companies or scientists using data to recommend movies, discover who is pregnant based on credit card receipts, or confirm the existence of the Higgs Boson regularly appear in Forbes, the Economist, the Wall Street Journal, and The New York Times. But how does one turn data into this type of insight? The answer is data analysis and applied statistics. Data analysis is the process of finding the right data to answer your question, understanding the processes underlying the data, discovering the important patterns in the data, and then communicating your results to have the biggest possible impact. There is a critical shortage of people with these skills in the workforce, which is why Hal Varian (Chief Economist at Google) says that being a statistician will be the sexy job for the next 10 years.This course is an applied statistics course focusing on data analysis. The course will begin with an overview of how to organize, perform, and write-up data analyses. Then we will cover some of the most popular and widely used statistical methods like linear regression, principal components analysis, cross-validation, and p-values. Instead of focusing on mathematical details, the lectures will be designed to help you apply these techniques to real data using the R statistical programming language, interpret the results, and diagnose potential problems in your analysis.

Internet Giants: The Law and Economics of Media Platforms (Coursera),https://www.mooc-list.com/go.php?courseId=3298,"This seven-week course will explore the relationship between law and technology with a strong focus on the law of the United States with some comparisons to laws around the world, especially in Europe. Tech progress is an important source of economic growth and raises broader questions about the human condition, including how culture evolves and who controls that evolution. Technology also matters in countless other ways as it often establishes the framework in which governments interact with their citizens, both in allowing speech and blocking it and in establishing exactly what the boundaries are between private life and the government. And technology itself is powerfully shaped by the laws that apply in areas as diverse as copyright, antitrust, patents, privacy, speech law and the regulation of networks.","The course will explore seven topics:1. Microsoft: The Desktop vs. The Internet. We will start with a look at the technology path that led to the first personal computer in early 1975, the Altair 8800. That path starts with the vacuum tube, moves to transistors, then to integrated circuits and finally to the microprocessor. We will look at the early days of software on the personal computer and the competition between selling software and open-source approaches as well as the problem of software piracy. We will discus the public good nature of software. The 1981 launch of the IBM PC revolutionized the personal computer market and started the path to Microsoft's powerful position and eventual monopoly in that market with the selection of MS-DOS. We then turn to four antitrust cases against Microsoft: (1) the 1994 U.S. case relating to MS-DOS licensing practices; (2) the U.S. antitrust middleware case over Microsoft’s response to Netscape Navigator; (3) the European Union case regarding Windows Media Player; and (4) the EU browser case over Internet Explorer. These disputes arose at the point of maximal competition between the free-standing personal computer and the Internet world that would come after it and we may know enough now to assess how these cases influenced that competition.2. Google Emerges (and the World Responds). Google has emerged as one of the dominant platforms of the Internet era and that has led to corresponding scrutiny by regulators throughout the world. Decisions that Google makes about its algorithm can be life altering. Individuals are finding it more difficult to put away past mistakes, as Google never forgets, and businesses can find that their sales plummet if Google moves them from the first page of search results to a later page. With great power comes scrutiny and we will look at how government regulators have evaluated how Google has exercised its power. Both the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the European Union have undertaken substantial investigations of Google’s practices and we will look at both of those.3. Smartphones. The Internet started on the desktop but the Internet is increasingly mobile and people are seemingly tethered to their smartphones and tablets. And we have seen an interesting shift in that market away from Nokia handsets and the Blackberry to Apple's iPhone and its iOS platform and to the Android platform. The legal infrastructure of smartphones and tablets is extraordinarily complex. We will start by looking at U.S. spectrum policy and the effort to free up 500 megahertz of spectrum. We will look at the activities of standard setting organizations, including the IEEE and the creation of the 802.11 standard and Wi-Fi (or, if you prefer, wifi), the creation of patent pools and the regulation of standard essential patents. We will look at the FTC action against Google/Motorola Mobility and Apple's lawsuit against Samsung over utility and design patents relating to the iPhone. Finally, we will take a brief look at the European Commission's investigation into the Android platform.4. Nondiscrimination and Network Neutrality. Facebook has more than 1 billion users and measure that against a world population of roughly 7 billion and a total number of Internet users of roughly 2.5 billion. A course on law and technology simply has to grapple with the basic framework for regulating the Internet and a key idea there is the notion of network neutrality. Nondiscrimination obligations are frequent in regulated network industries, but at the same, discrimination can be an important tool of design for communication networks. We will start our look at the Internet by looking at the great first communications network of the United States, the post office and will look in particular at the Post Office Act of 1845. We will then move to modern times and will consider efforts by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission to produce sensible and sustainable nondiscrimination conditions for the Internet and will touch briefly on comparisons from around the world.5. The Day the Music Died? In many ways, the Internet came first to music with the rise of peer-to-peer (p2p) music sharing through Napster and its successors. We start with a look into music platform history and the devices that brought recorded music into the home: the phonograph and the player piano. We turn to radio and the legal regime that puts music on the airwaves, the performing rights organizations like ASCAP and BMI. We look at the antitrust issues associated with the blanket license. We consider a failed music platform, digital audio tape, and the complicated legal regime associated with it, the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992. We will consider the copyright issues raised by the creation and distribution of music and the litigation over the p2p technologies such as Napster and Grokster. The music industry responded to p2p technology by adding digital rights management tools to CDs. As music distribution switched from physical media to digital distribution, we entered the world of Apple and the iPod and iTunes. We consider the DRM issues associated with Apple's music platform as seen by Steve Jobs. We conclude by looking at emerging subscription services like Spotify and the service that Apple is building based on its purchase of Beats.6. Video: Listening and Watching. Images are some of the most powerful ways in which ideas and speech are communicated and video has long been regulated by the state. That starts as a communications law issue with government regulation of the radio spectrum, but also leads to the design of the television system with the assignment of channels and eventually the definition of digital television. And with the emergence first of cable TV and subsequently the VCR critical copyright roadblocks had to be overcome for new distribution technologies to emerge. We will consider the legal engineering that led to the DVD platform, which was an exercise in patent pools and trademark creation. We will sort through the creation of the digital TV platform and will also look at the copyright underpinnings for Netflix. And we will consider the question of technology neutrality in the content of the copyright fight over a new video distribution entrant, Aereo. Finally, we close the week with a brief look at the incentive spectrum auctions and the possible end of broadcast television.7. The Mediated Book. Gutenberg revolutionized books with his printing press and for academics, books are sacred objects. But the printed book is on the run and with the rise of the ebook, we are entering a new era, the era of the mediated book. This is more than just a change in technology. We will look at the issues created by the rise of the ebook, issues about control over content and licensing and of the privacy of thought itself. We will also look at the legal skirmishes over this space, including the copyright fair use litigation over Google Books, the Apple e-book antitrust case. And we will look at the Amazon Kindle platform.To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 videoSyllabusWeek 1: Introduction to the CourseThis is a course on the law and economics of media platforms. Media delivery is frequently organized around a set of tools that bring together different parties to interact. Edison’s phonograph and wax cylinders did that, bringing together music producers and consumers wanting to listen to music at home, but so does Microsoft Windows, which sits between software developers and computer users.Week 2: Microsoft: The Desktop v. The InternetIn this module, we will focus on Microsoft and its arc from start up to dominance and repeated antitrust target. We will look at the technology leading to the personal computer and the release of the IBM PC in August, 1981 and then the rise of Microsoft from there. We will turn to antitrust actions against Microsoft, first in the United States in 1994 for its MS-DOS licensing practices and then again in the United States in 1998 for its response to the Internet and Netscape Navigator. We will then turn to two competition policy actions against Microsoft in Europe.Graded: Graded QuizWeek 3: Google Emerges (and the World Responds)In this module, we will focus on Google and its arc from 1998 start up to dominance and repeated antitrust target. We will look at the underlying tech, two-sided markets and auctions and then at antitrust investigations in the U.S. and the EU.Graded: Graded QuizWeek 4: SmartphonesIn this module, we will focus on the emergence of the smartphones platform. That is an interesting mix of government policy (especially regarding spectrum), collective private activity (standard setting, such as that for the 802.11 standard and for Wi-Fi), and individual private actions (such as that leading to the Apple iPhone and the Android platform).Graded: Graded QuizWeek 5: Nondiscrimination and NeutralityIn this module, we will focus on the issue of network neutrality, or, as the U.S. Federal Communications Commission likes to put it, the open Internet.Graded: Graded QuizWeek 6: The Day the Music Died?In this module, we will focus on different platforms for distributing music. That will start with the great home technology of the early 1900s—the phonograph and the player piano—before turning to radio and the ASCAP and BMI licensing regime for public performances. We then will turn to a failed technology and legal regime, digital audio tape and the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992. We will then switch to MP3 players, from the relatively obscure (the Diamond Rio) to the ubiquitous (the iPod) and to Apple’s digital rights management regime. We will then switch to the issues raised by peer-to-peer software like Napster and Grokster and then close with an examination of the switch from physical distribution media to digital and subscriptions like Spotify.Graded: Graded QuizWeek 7: Video: Listening and WatchingIn this module, we will focus on the different platforms for delivering video to the home. We will start with the history of TV in the U.S. in the 1940s and then jump to the copyright issues associated with the creation of cable TV in the 1960s and 1970s. We will then switch to considering two devices (the VCR and the DVD player), two services (Netflix and Aereo) and then creation of digital TV.Graded: Graded QuizWeek 8: The Mediated BookIn this module, we will focus on the emergence of digital books and digital libraries. Three topics loom large: (1) Google’s efforts to copy millions of books and bring them online through Google Books; (2) Amazon’s creation of the Kindle ebook platform; and (3) Apple’s launch of the iPad with its associated bookstore and the resulting antitrust lawsuit over that launch.Graded: Graded QuizWeek 9: Course ReviewWe review the entire course in this last module.Graded: Final ExamInternet Giants: ExperimentalDone with the course?

"Comparing Genes, Proteins, and Genomes (Bioinformatics III) (Coursera)",https://www.mooc-list.com/go.php?courseId=3320,"After sequencing genomes, we would like to compare them. We will see that dynamic programming is a powerful algorithmic tool when we compare two genes (i.e., short sequences of DNA) or two proteins. When we ""zoom out"" to compare entire genomes, we will employ combinatorial algorithms.","Once we have sequenced genomes in the previous course, we would like to compare them to determine how species have evolved and what makes them different.In the first half of the course, we will compare two short biological sequences, such as genes (i.e., short sequences of DNA) or proteins. We will encounter a powerful algorithmic tool called dynamic programming that will help us determine the number of mutations that have separated the two genes/proteins.In the second half of the course, we will ""zoom out"" to compare entire genomes, where we see large scale mutations called genome rearrangements, seismic events that have heaved around large blocks of DNA over millions of years of evolution. Looking at the human and mouse genomes, we will ask ourselves: just as earthquakes are much more likely to occur along fault lines, are there locations in our genome that are ""fragile"" and more susceptible to be broken as part of genome rearrangements? We will see how combinatorial algorithms will help us answer this question.Finally, you will learn how to apply popular bioinformatics software tools to solve problems in sequence alignment, including BLAST.Part of the Bioinformatics: Journey to the Frontier of Computational Biology Specialization.Who is this class for:This course is primarily aimed at undergraduate-level learners in computer science, biology, or a related field who are interested in learning about how the intersection of these two disciplines represents an important frontier in modern science.To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 videoSyllabusWEEK 1Introduction to Sequence AlignmentIf you joined us in the previous course in this Specialization, then you became an expert at assembling genomes and sequencing antibiotics. The next natural question to ask is how to compare DNA and amino acid sequences. This question will motivate this week's discussion of sequence alignment, which is the first of two questions that we will ask in this class (the algorithmic methods used to answer them are shown in parentheses):How Do We Compare DNA Sequences?

(Combinatorial Algorithms)Graded: Week 1 QuizGraded: Open in order to Sync Your Progress: Stepik Interactive Text for Week 1WEEK 2From Finding a Longest Path to Aligning DNA StringsLast week, we saw how touring around Manhattan and making change in a Roman shop help us find a longest common subsequence of two DNA or protein strings.This week, we will study how to find a highest scoring alignment of two strings. We will see that regardless of the underlying assumptions that we make regarding how the strings should be aligned, we will be able to phrase our alignment problem as an instance of finding the longest path in a directed acyclic graph.Graded: Week 2 QuizGraded: Open in order to Sync Your Progress: Stepik Interactive Text for Week 2WEEK 3Advanced Topics in Sequence AlignmentLast week, we saw how a variety of different applications of sequence alignment can all be reduced to finding the longest path in a Manhattan-like graph.This week, we will conclude the current chapter by considering a few advanced topics in sequence alignment. For example, if we need to align long strings, our current algorithm will consume a huge amount of memory. Can we find a more memory-efficient approach? And what should we do when we move from aligning just two strings at a time to aligning many strings?Graded: Week 3 QuizGraded: Open in order to Sync Your Progress: Stepik Interactive Text for Week 3WEEK 4Genome Rearrangements and FragilityYou now know how to compare two DNA (or protein) strings.  But what if we wanted to compare entire genomes? When we ""zoom out"" to the genome level, we find that substitutions, insertions, and deletions don't tell the whole story of evolution: we need to model more dramatic evolutionary events known as genome rearrangements, which wrench apart chromosomes and put them back together in a new order. A natural question to ask is whether there are ""fragile regions"" hidden in your genome where chromosome breakage has occurred more often over millions of years. This week, we will begin addressing this question by asking how we can compute the number of rearrangements on the evolutionary path connecting two species.Graded: Week 4 QuizGraded: Open in order to Sync Your Progress: Stepik Interactive Text for Week 4WEEK 5Applying Genome Rearrangement Analysis to Find Genome FragilityLast week, we asked whether there are fragile regions in the human genome.

The idea is to perturb different types of human cells with many different types of perturbations such as: drugs and other small molecules; genetic manipulations such as knockdown or overexpression of genes; manipulation of the extracellular microenvironment conditions, for example, growing cells on different surfaces, and more. These perturbations are applied to various types of human cells including induced pluripotent stem cells from patients, differentiated into various lineages such as neurons or cardiomyocytes. Then, to better understand the molecular networks that are affected by these perturbations, changes in level of many different variables are measured including: mRNAs, proteins, and metabolites, as well as cellular phenotypic changes such as changes in cell morphology. In most cases, the data that is collected is genome-wide and from across different regulatory layers.The BD2K-LINCS Data Coordination and Integration Center (DCIC) is commissioned to organize, analyze, visualize and integrate this data with other publicly available relevant resources. In this course we will introduce the various Centers that collect data for LINCS, describing the experimental data procedures and the various data types. We will then cover the design and collection of meta-data and how meta-data is linked to ontologies. We will then cover basic data processing and data normalization methods to clean and harmonize LINCS data. This will follow a discussion about how the data is served as RESTful APIs and JSON, and for this we will cover concepts from client-server computing. Most importantly, the course will focus on various methods of analysis including: unsupervised clustering, gene-set enrichment analyses, Bayesian integration, network visualization, and supervised machine learning applications to LINCS data and other relevant Big Data from molecular biomedicine.

You will discover the powerful mechanisms that are offered to build and manipulate complex data structures in a clean and efficient way. And you will see how functions play a central role, as first-class values that can be freely used in any place where an expression can appear.The OCaml programming language is a member of the ML language family pioneered by Robin Milner. An important feature of OCaml is that it reconciles the conciseness and flexibility of untyped programming languages (like Python, for example) with the safety of strongly typed programming languages (like Java, for example). The OCaml compiler performs in fact a type inference: types of identifiers do not have to be declared but are inferred by the compiler at the moment of definition of an identifier, and then used for assuring type correctness when using an identifier.We will start by using OCaml as a purely functional programming language. At the end of this MOOC we will see that OCaml is in fact a multi-paradigm language which allows you to combine the functional programming style with the imperative programming paradigm.Course ScheduleWeek 0: Introduction and overviewWeek 1: Basic types, definitions and functionsWeek 2: Basic data structuresWeek 3: More advanced data structuresWeek 4: Higher order functionsWeek 5: Exceptions, input/output and imperative constructsWeek 6: Modules and data abstraction",Sep 17th 2018,6 Weeks,"['Programming', 'OCaml', 'Functional Programming', 'Data Structures']"

 Writing for Web & Mobile (Aquent),https://www.mooc-list.com/go.php?courseId=4019,"Writing For Web & Mobile is for anyone who has to write content that users see. Designers, developers, marketing folks, copywriters, and product/project managers can all benefit from taking a data-driven approach to their content decision-making.","If you’re looking for a course on how to “spice up” existing content with flowery language, this isn’t it. We’re going to use real data from tools like Google Analytics and Google Keyword Planner to help us make content decisions. Some people might think this is boring and uncreative, but our goal is to be “authentic” rather than “viral,” and rest assured, the two aren’t mutually exclusive — as you’ll soon see for yourself!Here are 6 things you’ll get from this course: - Case studies of companies whose content is compelling and builds trust - Tools for finding the “right” words (Hint: We’ll be researching our audience!) - How to distill audience research into a Language Board that guides your writing - A methodology for doing Content-First UX Design for any device - Practice writing compelling content for email messages and blog posts - Content, context, and device considerations for desktop versus mobileCourse Outline: - Lesson One: Seeing Content As Conversation Train your inner copywriter to begin recognizing Reliable, Authentic, and Direct content which we refer to in this course as ""Lean Content."" We will review case studies of companies whose content is compelling and, as a result, builds trust. Additionally, we will define the difference between Content Strategy and Content Marketing and discuss the importance of how to measure engagement and conversions. - Lesson Two: Finding The Content Our Customers Want To help find the “right” words for your content you need to study your customer’s natural (organic) language. Writing content based on the words that customers use helps produce content that your customers will respond to. We will use Google Analytics to study the analytics of an existing website in order to understand the content customers want. We will use Google Keyword Planner to study the keywords customers are using on search engines. We will also look at other tools such as organic search results and social networks. - Lesson Three: Creating A Content Workbook A Content Workbook is a simple document (similar to an outline) that serves as a content roadmap for your website or mobile project. The Workbook incorporates audience research/data, uses the language we want to use with customers, and provides real content that will eventually be useful for the user experience process. We will walk through the process of building a Content Workbook from scratch in Google Docs. - Lesson Four: Using Data To Write A Language Board A Language Board represents the core conversation that a company wants to have with its highest value target customers. It’s built upon the existing research and content recommendations and is where “real” content starts to be written. We will walk through the process of building a Language Board in Google Docs. - Lesson Five: Content-First UX Design With Conversation Maps A Conversation Map is a text-only representation of an end-to-end transaction and includes the messaging a user will see from start to finish. From a practical perspective, the Conversation Map becomes the labels, callouts and microcopy that your team needs to design and develop your website or mobile app. We will build upon the previous lessons and build a Conversation Map that will be ready to hand off to developers and/or others on a project team. - Lesson Six: Making Content-First Design Work In Real Life In this lesson, we take a look at how the entire process covered in the first five lessons actually works by walking through a case study of the Annie E.

This homework is given in the context of the following scenario:“You, being the only ‘security person’ in the area, have been called in toexamine a running Windows server because ""it's acting funny."" They don'tcare that you like Mac/Linux/BSD/Plan9 better, you need to look at it! Youare solemnly informed that this is system is mission critical and can onlybe rebooted if absolutely necessary. You must investigate whether any sortof compromise has taken place on the system, with minimal impact to themission. What do you do? What DO you DO?”The homework is then for the student to use any means at their disposal to write up answers to the following questions: “What malicious changes were made to the system?”, “What tools did you use to detect the changes?”, “How can you remove the changes?”. The students’ answers are then anonymized and shared with the rest of the class afterwards, so that they can see how others approached the problem, and learn from their techniques. The anonymization of the homework before distribution is important so that students know that even though they don’t know, and aren’t expected to know, anything about the area yet, their entry will not be judged by other students.Recommended Readings:",Self Paced,Self-Paced,"['Computing', 'Security', 'Programming', 'Malware', 'Rootkits']"

The core goal of classification is to predict a category or class y from some inputs x. Through this course, you will become familiar with the fundamental models and algorithms used in classification, as well as a number of core machine learning concepts. Rather than covering all aspects of classification, you will focus on a few core techniques, which are widely used in the real-world to get state-of-the-art performance. By following our hands-on approach, you will implement your own algorithms on multiple real-world tasks, and deeply grasp the core techniques needed to be successful with these approaches in practice. This introduction to the course provides you with an overview of the topics we will cover and the background knowledge and resources we assume you have.Linear Classifiers & Logistic RegressionLinear classifiers are amongst the most practical classification methods. For example, in our sentiment analysis case-study, a linear classifier associates a coefficient with the counts of each word in the sentence. In this module, you will become proficient in this type of representation. You will focus on a particularly useful type of linear classifier called logistic regression, which, in addition to allowing you to predict a class, provides a probability associated with the prediction. These probabilities are extremely useful, since they provide a degree of confidence in the predictions. In this module, you will also be able to construct features from categorical inputs, and to tackle classification problems with more than two class (multiclass problems). You will examine the results of these techniques on a real-world product sentiment analysis task.Graded: Linear Classifiers & Logistic RegressionGraded: Predicting sentiment from product reviewsWEEK 2Learning Linear ClassifiersOnce familiar with linear classifiers and logistic regression, you can now dive in and write your first learning algorithm for classification. In particular, you will use gradient ascent to learn the coefficients of your classifier from data. You first will need to define the quality metric for these tasks using an approach called maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). You will also become familiar with a simple technique for selecting the step size for gradient ascent. An optional, advanced part of this module will cover the derivation of the gradient for logistic regression. You will implement your own learning algorithm for logistic regression from scratch, and use it to learn a sentiment analysis classifier.Graded: Learning Linear ClassifiersGraded: Implementing logistic regression from scratchOverfitting & Regularization in Logistic RegressionAs we saw in the regression course, overfitting is perhaps the most significant challenge you will face as you apply machine learning approaches in practice. This challenge can be particularly significant for logistic regression, as you will discover in this module, since we not only risk getting an overly complex decision boundary, but your classifier can also become overly confident about the probabilities it predicts. In this module, you will investigate overfitting in classification in significant detail, and obtain broad practical insights from some interesting visualizations of the classifiers' outputs. You will then add a regularization term to your optimization to mitigate overfitting. You will investigate both L2 regularization to penalize large coefficient values, and L1 regularization to obtain additional sparsity in the coefficients. Finally, you will modify your gradient ascent algorithm to learn regularized logistic regression classifiers. You will implement your own regularized logistic regression classifier from scratch, and investigate the impact of the L2 penalty on real-world sentiment analysis data.Graded: Overfitting & Regularization in Logistic RegressionGraded: Logistic Regression with L2 regularizationWEEK 3Decision TreesAlong with linear classifiers, decision trees are amongst the most widely used classification techniques in the real world. This method is extremely intuitive, simple to implement and provides interpretable predictions. In this module, you will become familiar with the core decision trees representation. You will then design a simple, recursive greedy algorithm to learn decision trees from data. Finally, you will extend this approach to deal with continuous inputs, a fundamental requirement for practical problems. In this module, you will investigate a brand new case-study in the financial sector: predicting the risk associated with a bank loan. You will implement your own decision tree learning algorithm on real loan data.Graded: Decision TreesGraded: Identifying safe loans with decision treesGraded: Implementing binary decision treesWEEK 4Preventing Overfitting in Decision TreesOut of all machine learning techniques, decision trees are amongst the most prone to overfitting. No practical implementation is possible without including approaches that mitigate this challenge. In this module, through various visualizations and investigations, you will investigate why decision trees suffer from significant overfitting problems. Using the principle of Occam's razor, you will mitigate overfitting by learning simpler trees. At first, you will design algorithms that stop the learning process before the decision trees become overly complex. In an optional segment, you will design a very practical approach that learns an overly-complex tree, and then simplifies it with pruning. Your implementation will investigate the effect of these techniques on mitigating overfitting on our real-world loan data set.Graded: Preventing Overfitting in Decision TreesGraded: Decision Trees in PracticeHandling Missing DataReal-world machine learning problems are fraught with missing data. That is, very often, some of the inputs are not observed for all data points. This challenge is very significant, happens in most cases, and needs to be addressed carefully to obtain great performance. And, this issue is rarely discussed in machine learning courses. In this module, you will tackle the missing data challenge head on. You will start with the two most basic techniques to convert a dataset with missing data into a clean dataset, namely skipping missing values and inputing missing values. In an advanced section, you will also design a modification of the decision tree learning algorithm that builds decisions about missing data right into the model. You will also explore these techniques in your real-data implementation.Graded: Handling Missing DataWEEK 5BoostingOne of the most exciting theoretical questions that have been asked about machine learning is whether simple classifiers can be combined into a highly accurate ensemble. This question lead to the developing of boosting, one of the most important and practical techniques in machine learning today. This simple approach can boost the accuracy of any classifier, and is widely used in practice, e.g., it's used by more than half of the teams who win the Kaggle machine learning competitions. In this module, you will first define the ensemble classifier, where multiple models vote on the best prediction. You will then explore a boosting algorithm called AdaBoost, which provides a great approach for boosting classifiers. Through visualizations, you will become familiar with many of the practical aspects of this techniques. You will create your very own implementation of AdaBoost, from scratch, and use it to boost the performance of your loan risk predictor on real data.Graded: Exploring Ensemble MethodsGraded: BoostingGraded: Boosting a decision stumpWEEK 6Precision-RecallIn many real-world settings, accuracy or error are not the best quality metrics for classification. You will explore a case-study that significantly highlights this issue: using sentiment analysis to display positive reviews on a restaurant website. Instead of accuracy, you will define two metrics: precision and recall, which are widely used in real-world applications to measure the quality of classifiers. You will explore how the probabilities output by your classifier can be used to trade-off precision with recall, and dive into this spectrum, using precision-recall curves. In your hands-on implementation, you will compute these metrics with your learned classifier on real-world sentiment analysis data.Graded: Precision-RecallGraded: Exploring precision and recallWEEK 7Scaling to Huge Datasets & Online LearningWith the advent of the internet, the growth of social media, and the embedding of sensors in the world, the magnitudes of data that our machine learning algorithms must handle have grown tremendously over the last decade. This effect is sometimes called ""Big Data"". Thus, our learning algorithms must scale to bigger and bigger datasets. In this module, you will develop a small modification of gradient ascent called stochastic gradient, which provides significant speedups in the running time of our algorithms. This simple change can drastically improve scaling, but makes the algorithm less stable and harder to use in practice. In this module, you will investigate the practical techniques needed to make stochastic gradient viable, and to thus to obtain learning algorithms that scale to huge datasets. You will also address a new kind of machine learning problem, online learning, where the data streams in over time, and we must learn the coefficients as the data arrives. This task can also be solved with stochastic gradient. You will implement your very own stochastic gradient ascent algorithm for logistic regression from scratch, and evaluate it on sentiment analysis data.Graded: Scaling to Huge Datasets & Online LearningGraded: Training Logistic Regression via Stochastic Gradient Ascent",Sep 9th 2019,7 Weeks,"['Machine Learning Specialization', 'Machine Learning', 'Classification', 'Analysing Sentiment', 'Prediction', 'Ad Targeting', 'Spam Detection', 'Medical Diagnosis', 'Python']"

You will be able to handle very large sets of features and select between models of various complexity. You will also analyze the impact of aspects of your data -- such as outliers -- on your selected models and predictions.

It allows you to make predictions from data by learning the relationship between features of your data and some observed, continuous-valued response. Regression is used in a massive number of applications ranging from predicting stock prices to understanding gene regulatory networks.This introduction to the course provides you with an overview of the topics we will cover and the background knowledge and resources we assume you have.Simple Linear RegressionOur course starts from the most basic regression model: Just fitting a line to data. This simple model for forming predictions from a single, univariate feature of the data is appropriately called ""simple linear regression"". In this module, we describe the high-level regression task and then specialize these concepts to the simple linear regression case. You will learn how to formulate a simple regression model and fit the model to data using both a closed-form solution as well as an iterative optimization algorithm called gradient descent. Based on this fitted function, you will interpret the estimated model parameters and form predictions. You will also analyze the sensitivity of your fit to outlying observations. You will examine all of these concepts in the context of a case study of predicting house prices from the square feet of the house.Graded: Simple Linear RegressionGraded: Fitting a simple linear regression model on housing dataWEEK 2Multiple RegressionThe next step in moving beyond simple linear regression is to consider ""multiple regression"" where multiple features of the data are used to form predictions. More specifically, in this module, you will learn how to build models of more complex relationship between a single variable (e.g., 'square feet') and the observed response (like 'house sales price'). This includes things like fitting a polynomial to your data, or capturing seasonal changes in the response value. You will also learn how to incorporate multiple input variables (e.g., 'square feet', '# bedrooms', '# bathrooms'). You will then be able to describe how all of these models can still be cast within the linear regression framework, but now using multiple ""features"". Within this multiple regression framework, you will fit models to data, interpret estimated coefficients, and form predictions. Here, you will also implement a gradient descent algorithm for fitting a multiple regression model.Graded: Multiple RegressionGraded: Exploring different multiple regression models for house price predictionGraded: Implementing gradient descent for multiple regressionWEEK 3Assessing PerformanceHaving learned about linear regression models and algorithms for estimating the parameters of such models, you are now ready to assess how well your considered method should perform in predicting new data. You are also ready to select amongst possible models to choose the best performing. This module is all about these important topics of model selection and assessment. You will examine both theoretical and practical aspects of such analyses. You will first explore the concept of measuring the ""loss"" of your predictions, and use this to define training, test, and generalization error. For these measures of error, you will analyze how they vary with model complexity and how they might be utilized to form a valid assessment of predictive performance. This leads directly to an important conversation about the bias-variance tradeoff, which is fundamental to machine learning. Finally, you will devise a method to first select amongst models and then assess the performance of the selected model. The concepts described in this module are key to all machine learning problems, well-beyond the regression setting addressed in this course.Graded: Assessing PerformanceGraded: Exploring the bias-variance tradeoffWEEK 4Ridge RegressionYou have examined how the performance of a model varies with increasing model complexity, and can describe the potential pitfall of complex models becoming overfit to the training data. In this module, you will explore a very simple, but extremely effective technique for automatically coping with this issue. This method is called ""ridge regression"". You start out with a complex model, but now fit the model in a manner that not only incorporates a measure of fit to the training data, but also a term that biases the solution away from overfitted functions. To this end, you will explore symptoms of overfitted functions and use this to define a quantitative measure to use in your revised optimization objective. You will derive both a closed-form and gradient descent algorithm for fitting the ridge regression objective; these forms are small modifications from the original algorithms you derived for multiple regression. To select the strength of the bias away from overfitting, you will explore a general-purpose method called ""cross validation"". You will implement both cross-validation and gradient descent to fit a ridge regression model and select the regularization constant.Graded: Ridge RegressionGraded: Observing effects of L2 penalty in polynomial regressionGraded: Implementing ridge regression via gradient descentWEEK 5Feature Selection & LassoA fundamental machine learning task is to select amongst a set of features to include in a model. In this module, you will explore this idea in the context of multiple regression, and describe how such feature selection is important for both interpretability and efficiency of forming predictions. To start, you will examine methods that search over an enumeration of models including different subsets of features. You will analyze both exhaustive search and greedy algorithms. Then, instead of an explicit enumeration, we turn to Lasso regression, which implicitly performs feature selection in a manner akin to ridge regression: A complex model is fit based on a measure of fit to the training data plus a measure of overfitting different than that used in ridge. This lasso method has had impact in numerous applied domains, and the ideas behind the method have fundamentally changed machine learning and statistics. You will also implement a coordinate descent algorithm for fitting a Lasso model. Coordinate descent is another, general, optimization technique, which is useful in many areas of machine learning.Graded: Feature Selection and LassoGraded: Using LASSO to select featuresGraded: Implementing LASSO using coordinate descentWEEK 6Nearest Neighbors & Kernel RegressionUp to this point, we have focused on methods that fit parametric functions---like polynomials and hyperplanes---to the entire dataset. In this module, we instead turn our attention to a class of ""nonparametric"" methods. These methods allow the complexity of the model to increase as more data are observed, and result in fits that adapt locally to the observations. We start by considering the simple and intuitive example of nonparametric methods, nearest neighbor regression: The prediction for a query point is based on the outputs of the most related observations in the training set. This approach is extremely simple, but can provide excellent predictions, especially for large datasets. You will deploy algorithms to search for the nearest neighbors and form predictions based on the discovered neighbors. Building on this idea, we turn to kernel regression. Instead of forming predictions based on a small set of neighboring observations, kernel regression uses all observations in the dataset, but the impact of these observations on the predicted value is weighted by their similarity to the query point. You will analyze the theoretical performance of these methods in the limit of infinite training data, and explore the scenarios in which these methods work well versus struggle. You will also implement these techniques and observe their practical behavior.Graded: Nearest Neighbors & Kernel RegressionGraded: Predicting house prices using k-nearest neighbors regressionClosing RemarksIn the conclusion of the course, we will recap what we have covered. This represents both techniques specific to regression, as well as foundational machine learning concepts that will appear throughout the specialization.

Ruby on Rails: An Introduction (Coursera),https://www.mooc-list.com/go.php?courseId=4228,"Did you ever want to build a web application? Perhaps you even started down that path in a language like Java or C#, when you realized that there was so much “climbing the mountain” that you had to do? Maybe you have heard about web services being all the rage, but thought they were too complicated to integrate into your web application. Or maybe you wondered how deploying web applications to the cloud works, but there was too much to set up just to get going.","In this course, we will explore how to build web applications with the Ruby on Rails web application framework, which is geared towards rapid prototyping. Yes, that means building quickly! At the conclusion of this course, you will be able to build a meaningful web application and deploy it to the “cloud” using a Heroku PaaS (Platform as a Service). Best of all, it will almost feel effortless… Really!“But wait”, you will say, “there is no way that we can build a useful application if there is no database involved. You need the data for an application to be useful.” Great point! But what if… instead of getting the data from the database, we get it from the internet by tapping into one of the web services out there that readily provides data needed by our application? “Ok, but that’s probably very complicated”, you will say.

Rails with Active Record and Action Pack (Coursera),https://www.mooc-list.com/go.php?courseId=4229,"You already know how to build a basic web application with the Ruby on Rails framework. Perhaps, you have even taken Course 1, ""Ruby on Rails: An Introduction"" (we highly recommend it) where you relied on external web services to be your “data layer”. But in the back of your mind, you always knew that there would come a time when you would need to roll up your sleeves and learn SQL to be able to interact with your own relational database (RDBMS). But there is an easier way to get started with SQL using the Active Record Object/Relational (ORM) framework. In this course, we will be able to use the Ruby language and the Active Record ORM framework to automate interactions with the database to quickly build the application we want.","In Rails with Active Record and Action Pack, we will explore how to interact with relational databases by using Active Record, a Ruby gem, which Rails uses by default for database access. We will then take a look at what role Active Record plays in the overall request-response cycle, when a client (the browser) requests data from the server, as well as how to submit the data to the server. Of course, when accessing data, security is of paramount importance! We will talk about vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, as well as how to secure access to data by authenticating and authorizing users accessing the data.

Before we begin with the how, we will talk about the why, mainly why we want to use JavaScript. The main reason is that it is very easy for JavaScript to work with the DOM. And easy is always a great way to start. Speaking of starting out, it is also always more fun when our code actually does something we can see, so we will jump quickly into different ways we can generate output. It won't be flashy yet, but it will be a great way to get your feet wet with traditional programming. After that we go back to the basics of how a computer uses data. We begin with variables, expressions, and operators.WEEK 2Reacting to Your AudienceIf you have written HTML code in the past, hopefully you have fallen into the great habit of validating your code -- making sure that you close all of your open tags. There are other rules that you may or may not have been following as well, for instance the importance of using each id attribute only once per page. This is called writing ""clean"" code.

Advanced Styling with Responsive Design (Coursera),https://www.mooc-list.com/go.php?courseId=4245,"It used to be the case that everyone viewed webpages on about the same size screen. But with the explosion of the use of smartphones to access the Internet, the landscape of design has completely changed. People viewing your site will now expect that it will perform regardless of the platform (smartphone, tablet, laptop, or desktop computer). This ability to respond to any platform is called responsive design.","This course will expand upon the basic knowledge of CSS3 to include topics such as wireframes, fluid design, media queries, and the use of existing styling paradigms such as Bootstrap.

How can you tell if your existing site is responsive? This week we will begin with the theories behind the ""mobile-first paradigm"" - the idea that your mobile site should provide everything needed, not a pared-down version of a good page. We end the week by taking the first concrete step of using fluid measurements in your CSS.Graded: Basic Concepts in Responsive Design approachesWEEK 2Basic ConceptsThis week you will get a chance to put the theories into practice using media queries in your CSS. These queries can automatically detect the size of the browser being used to view the page so that you can decide what type of look you want to achieve. There will also be a discussion on common practices for designing your different views at various screen sizes (""viewports"").Graded: Week Two Review: Media Queries and breakpointsWEEK 3Use Existing FrameworksAfter every good programmer has put in time creating sites from scratch, it is common to utilize existing tools out there. After all, why recreate the wheel? The work you have done up to this point will give you the knowledge needed to craft your own unique sites from these frameworks. This week we will work with Bootstrap, a framework that uses HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript (but don't worry if you have never used JavaScript yourself).Graded: Week Three Review: BootstrapWEEK 4Experiment!This week is dedicated to solving those little issues that pop up when you move from theory to practice. We look at more advanced framework options and also hear from people who are using the techniques covered in this course.Graded: Responsive Design Final Assessment",Sep 9th 2019,4 Weeks,"['Responsive Design', 'Web Design', 'Web Development', 'Coding', 'Advanced Styling', 'CSS3', 'Wireframes', 'Fluid Design', 'Bootstrap', 'Styling']"

Mastering Data Analysis in Excel (Coursera),https://www.mooc-list.com/go.php?courseId=4269,"In business, data and algorithms create economic value when they reduce uncertainty about financially important outcomes. This course teaches the concepts and mathematical methods behind the most powerful and universal metrics used by Data Scientists to evaluate the uncertainty-reduction – or information gain - predictive models provide. We focus on the two most common types of predictive model - binary classification and linear regression - and you will learn metrics to quantify for yourself the exact reduction in uncertainty each can offer. These metrics are applicable to any form of model that uses new information to improve predictions cast in the form of a known probability distribution – the standard way of representing forecasts in data science.","In addition, you will learn proper methodology to avoid common data-analytic pitfalls when forecasting – such as being “fooled by randomness” and over-fitting “noise” as if it were “signal.”Uniquely among data-analytics offerings, this course empowers you to understand and apply quite advanced information theory methods – Bayesian Logical Data Analysis - in business practice, without needing any calculus or matrix algebra, or any knowledge of Matlab or R or software programming.You will be able to answer all homework and quiz questions either by using basic algebra, or with the special custom Microsoft Excel Templates provided. Nor is any prior experience with Excel required; we will cover in detail at the beginning everything you need to know about using Excel to succeed in the course itself.

Applicants who want to prepare for an interview in a high-tech company.Course 1 of 6 in the Data Structures and Algorithms SpecializationSyllabusWEEK 1WelcomeWelcome to the first module of Data Structures and Algorithms! Here we will provide an overview of where algorithms and data structures are used (hint: everywhere) and walk you through a few sample programming challenges. The programming challenges represent an important (and often the most difficult!) part of this specialization because the only way to fully understand an algorithm is to implement it. Writing correct and efficient programs is hard; please don’t be surprised if they don’t work as you planned—our first programs did not work either! We will help you on your journey through the specialization by showing how to implement your first programming challenges. We will also introduce testing techniques that will help increase your chances of passing assignments on your first attempt. In case your program does not work as intended, we will show how to fix it, even if you don’t yet know which test your implementation is failing on.WEEK 2IntroductionIn this module you will learn that programs based on efficient algorithms can solve the same problem billions of times faster than programs based on naïve algorithms. You will learn how to estimate the running time and memory of an algorithm without even implementing it. Armed with this knowledge, you will be able to compare various algorithms, select the most efficient ones, and finally implement them as our programming challenges!WEEK 3Greedy AlgorithmsIn this module you will learn about seemingly naïve yet powerful class of algorithms called greedy algorithms. After you will learn the key idea behind the greedy algorithms, you may feel that they represent the algorithmic Swiss army knife that can be applied to solve nearly all programming challenges in this course. But be warned: with a few exceptions that we will cover, this intuitive idea rarely works in practice! For this reason, it is important to prove that a greedy algorithm always produces an optimal solution before using this algorithm. In the end of this module, we will test your intuition and taste for greedy algorithms by offering several programming challenges.WEEK 4Divide-and-ConquerIn this module you will learn about a powerful algorithmic technique called Divide and Conquer. Based on this technique, you will see how to search huge databases millions of times faster than using naïve linear search. You will even learn that the standard way to multiply numbers (that you learned in the grade school) is far from the being the fastest! We will then apply the divide-and-conquer technique to design two efficient algorithms (merge sort and quick sort) for sorting huge lists, a problem that finds many applications in practice. Finally, we will show that these two algorithms are optimal, that is, no algorithm can sort faster!WEEK 5Dynamic ProgrammingIn this final module of the course you will learn about the powerful algorithmic technique for solving many optimization problems called Dynamic Programming. It turned out that dynamic programming can solve many problems that evade all attempts to solve them using greedy or divide-and-conquer strategy. There are countless applications of dynamic programming in practice: from maximizing the advertisement revenue of a TV station, to search for similar Internet pages, to gene finding (the problem where biologists need to find the minimum number of mutations to transform one gene into another). You will learn how the same idea helps to automatically make spelling corrections and to show the differences between two versions of the same text.",Sep 9th 2019,5 Weeks,"['Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization', 'Algorithms', 'Data Structures', 'Sorting', 'Searching', 'Dynamic Programming']"
Advanced Algorithms and Complexity (Coursera),https://www.mooc-list.com/go.php?courseId=4333,"You've learned the basic algorithms now and are ready to step into the area of more complex problems and algorithms to solve them. Advanced algorithms build upon basic ones and use new ideas. We will start with networks flows which are used in more obvious applications such as optimal matchings, finding disjoint paths and flight scheduling as well as more surprising ones like image segmentation in computer vision or finding dense clusters in the advertiser-search query graphs at search engines.","We then proceed to linear programming with applications in optimizing budget allocation, portfolio optimization, finding the cheapest diet satisfying all requirements, call routing in telecommunications and many others. Next we discuss inherently hard problems for which no exact good solutions are known (and not likely to be found) and how to solve them approximately in a reasonable time. We finish with some applications to Big Data and Machine Learning which are heavy on algorithms right now.Who is this class for: Programmers with basic experience looking to understand the practical and conceptual underpinnings of algorithms, with the goal of becoming more effective software engineers. Computer science students and researchers as well as interdisciplinary students (studying electrical engineering, mathematics, bioinformatics, etc.) aiming to get more profound understanding of algorithms and hands-on experience implementing them and applying for real-world problems. Applicants who want to prepare for an interview in a high-tech company.Course 5 of 6 in the Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization.SyllabusWEEK 1Flows in NetworksNetwork flows show up in many real world situations in which a good needs to be transported across a network with limited capacity. You can see it when shipping goods across highways and routing packets across the internet. In this unit, we will discuss the mathematical underpinnings of network flows and some important flow algorithms. We will also give some surprising examples on seemingly unrelated problems that can be solved with our knowledge of network flows.WEEK 2Linear ProgrammingLinear programming is a very powerful algorithmic tool. Essentially, a linear programming problem asks you to optimize a linear function of real variables constrained by some system of linear inequalities. This is an extremely versatile framework that immediately generalizes flow problems, but can also be used to discuss a wide variety of other problems from optimizing production procedures to finding the cheapest way to attain a healthy diet. Surprisingly, this very general framework admits efficient algorithms. In this unit, we will discuss some of the importance of linear programming problems along with some of the tools used to solve them.WEEK 3NP-complete ProblemsAlthough many of the algorithms you've learned so far are applied in practice a lot, it turns out that the world is dominated by real-world problems without a known provably efficient algorithm. Many of these problems can be reduced to one of the classical problems called NP-complete problems which either cannot be solved by a polynomial algorithm or solving any one of them would win you a million dollars (see Millenium Prize Problems) and eternal worldwide fame for solving the main problem of computer science called P vs NP. It's good to know this before trying to solve a problem before the tomorrow's deadline :) Although these problems are very unlikely to be solvable efficiently in the nearest future, people always come up with various workarounds. In this module you will study the classical NP-complete problems and the reductions between them. You will also practice solving large instances of some of these problems despite their hardness using very efficient specialized software based on tons of research in the area of NP-complete problems.WEEK 4Coping with NP-completenessAfter the previous module you might be sad: you've just went through 5 courses in Algorithms only to learn that they are not suitable for most real-world problems. However, don't give up yet! People are creative, and they need to solve these problems anyway, so in practice there are often ways to cope with an NP-complete problem at hand. We first show that some special cases on NP-complete problems can, in fact, be solved in polynomial time. We then consider exact algorithms that find a solution much faster than the brute force algorithm. We conclude with approximation algorithms that work in polynomial time and find a solution that is close to being optimal.WEEK 5Streaming Algorithms (Optional)In most previous lectures we were interested in designing algorithms with fast (e.g. small polynomial) runtime, and assumed that the algorithm has random access to its input, which is loaded into memory. In many modern applications in big data analysis, however, the input is so large that it cannot be stored in memory. Instead, the input is presented as a stream of updates, which the algorithm scans while maintaining a small summary of the stream seen so far. This is precisely the setting of the streaming model of computation, which we study in this lecture. The streaming model is well-suited for designing and reasoning about small space algorithms. It has received a lot of attention in the literature, and several powerful algorithmic primitives for computing basic stream statistics in this model have been designed, several of them impacting the practice of big data analysis. In this lecture we will see one such algorithm (CountSketch), a small space algorithm for finding the top k most frequent items in a data stream.",Sep 9th 2019,4 Weeks,"['Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization', 'Algorithms', 'Data Structures', 'Machine Learning', 'Linear Programming', 'Network Flow']"

However, it contains a number of recitals and R Studio tutorials which will consolidate your competences, enable you to play more freely with data and explore new features and statistical functions in R.","Business Analytics, Big Data and Data Science are very hot topics today, and for good reasons. Companies are sitting on a treasure trove of data, but usually lack the skills and people to analyze and exploit that data efficiently. Those companies who develop the skills and hire the right people to analyze and exploit that data will have a clear competitive advantage.It's especially true in one domain: marketing. About 90% of the data collected by companies today are related to customer actions and marketing activities.The domain of Marketing Analytics is absolutely huge, and may cover fancy topics such as text mining, social network analysis, sentiment analysis, real-time bidding, online campaign optimization, and so on.But at the heart of marketing lie a few basic questions that often remain unanswered: (1) who are my customers, (2) which customers should I target and spend most of my marketing budget on, and (3) what's the future value of my customers so I can concentrate on those who will be worth the most to the company in the future.That's exactly what this course will cover: segmentation is all about understanding your customers, scorings models are about targeting the right ones, and customer lifetime value is about anticipating their future value. These are the foundations of Marketing Analytics. And that's what you'll learn to do in this course.Who is this course for?This course is designed for students, business analysts, and data scientists who want to apply statistical knowledge and techniques to business contexts.

You no longer have to scour through many different resources to learn it. If you are a beginner or an expert, this course has something for everybody.","So, what is OOP PHP and why is it the talk of the town?Object-oriented programming is based around objects rather than actions, which means the developer manipulates the object itself, rather than the logic required to manipulate them. In this sense, items that are similar or require constantly calling would be clubbed as one object, which would further have classes and sub classes. So, if the developer wants to modify or call all of the items under this object, instead of doing it individually and constantly repeating the code, he would only need to modify the main object and with it all the items clubbed under it would also be modified.

Advanced Data Structures in Java (Coursera),https://www.mooc-list.com/go.php?courseId=4426,"How does Google Maps plan the best route for getting around town given current traffic conditions? How does an internet router forward packets of network traffic to minimize delay? How does an aid group allocate resources to its affiliated local partners? To solve such problems, we first represent the key pieces of data in a complex data structure. In this course, you’ll learn about data structures, like graphs, that are fundamental for working with structured real world data."," You will develop, implement, and analyze algorithms for working with this data to solve real world problems.

Once again start with introductions, and in particular introduce the unique structure of this course. Also, if you're not sure if this course is right for you, we've got an optional pre-course quiz coming right up that can help you figure out if you're in the right place. If you decide to stay with us (and we really hope you will!) we'll dive right into the technical content and the backbone project, which is your very own mapping application, inspired by Google Maps! The core data structure throughout this course is graphs, which may very well be the most fundamental data structure in all of computer science. If you're not sure if this course is right for you, we've got an optional pre-course quiz that can help you figure out if you're in the right place. Ready to begin? So are we!WEEK 2Class design and simple graph searchThis week you'll get the backbone of your map search engine up and running. In previous courses, including the previous courses in this specialization, you've probably been given most of the classes you needed to complete the assignments. But learning how to design classes from scratch is a key skill that you will need as you become a more sophisticated Java programmer. This week we'll give you the tools you need to create a robust and elegant class design for your map search engine. We'll introduce a similar problem and show you how it can be represented as a graph. Then we'll introduce two core search algorithms: depth-first search and breadth-first search. Finally, we'll turn our graph problem into a set of Java classes. Your task on the programming assignment this week will be to do the same thing, but in the context on the map search engine!WEEK 3Finding shortest paths in weighted graphsIn the past two weeks, you've developed a strong understanding of how to design classes to represent a graph and how to use a graph to represent a map. In this week, you'll add a key feature of map data to our graph representation -- distances -- by adding weights to your edges to produce a ""weighted graph"". Although this might seem like a small change, the algorithms that work for unweighted graphs may prove ineffective for weighted graphs. To address this problem, you'll explore more advanced shortest path algorithms. First, you'll see how to find the shortest path on a weighted graph, then you'll see how to find it more quickly. In the project, you'll apply these ideas to create the core of any good mapping application: finding the shortest route from one location to another.WEEK 4Route planning and NP-hard graph problemsIn this week, we'll go beyond the problem of finding a path between two points, and focus on problems requiring overall path planning. For example, if you wanted to go on errands and visit 6 different locations before returning home, what is the optimal route? This problem is actually a really well known problem in computer science known as the Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP). Attempting to solve the problem will lead us to explore complexity theory, what it means to be NP-Hard, and how to solve ""hard"" problems using heuristics and approximation algorithms. We'll end the week by showing how reformulating a problem can have a huge impact: making something which was effectively unsolvable before, now solvable!WEEK 5End of Course Project ExtensionYou made it to the last week of our course! We're glad you're still with us. As a reward, there's no new content to learn this week. Instead you'll get the opportunity to extend your project in a direction of your own choosing. We hope you've got some neat ideas for personalizing your map application, and we look forward to seeing them in the peer review gallery. Submitting to the peer review gallery is optional (though the extension is required), but we hope you'll choose to participate.",Sep 9th 2019,5 Weeks,"['Data Structures', 'Java', 'Java Programming', 'Programming', 'Object-Oriented Design', 'Object-Oriented', 'Graphs', 'Algorithms']"
Data structures: Measuring and Optimising Performance (Coursera),https://www.mooc-list.com/go.php?courseId=4427,"How do Java programs deal with vast quantities of data? Many of the data structures and algorithms that work with introductory toy examples break when applications process real, large data sets. Efficiency is critical, but how do we achieve it, and how do we even measure it? In this course, you will use and analyze data structures that are used in industry-level applications, such as linked lists, trees, and hashtables.","You will explain how these data structures make programs more efficient and flexible. You will apply asymptotic Big-O analysis to describe the performance of algorithms and evaluate which strategy to use for efficient data retrieval, addition of new data, deletion of elements, and/or memory usage. The program you will build throughout this course allows its user to manage, manipulate and reason about large sets of textual data. This course is designed around the same video series as in our first course in this specialization, including explanations of core content, learner videos, student and engineer testimonials, and support videos -- to better allow you to choose your own path through the course!Course 2 of 5 in the Object Oriented Java Programming: Data Structures and Beyond Specialization.SyllabusWEEK 1Introduction to the Course and Working with StringsWelcome to the first module in the second course of our Intermediate Java Programming Specialization. We'll start with introductions again: to ourselves, the Google engineers, and the structure of the course. After introductions, we'll dive right into the course programming project with a lesson on Strings and Regular Expressions. This course is focused on building code that not only does interesting things, but also finishes them quickly. So, let's get started!WEEK 2Efficiency Analysis and BenchmarkingWelcome to week 2! The text-editor application you worked with last week does something, but it doesn't do it particularly fast. This week we'll start talking about efficiency. We'll introduce the concept of ""Big-O"" notation, which sounds a little silly, but is really a powerful (and extremely common) way of analyzing a program's efficiency, independent of the system that it's running on and the exact details of how it's implemented. Then we'll go the other direction and dive into the details, talking about how to measure the actual running time of a piece of code to get an idea of how it really performs in practice.WEEK 3Interfaces, Linked Lists vs. Arrays, and CorrectnessThis week we'll start talking about some of the basic concepts that one expects to find in a data structures course: the idea of data abstraction, and a data structure called a Linked List. Even though Linked Lists are not very efficient structures (for the most part), they do hit home the idea of ""linking"" pieces of data together in your computer's memory, rather than storing the data in one contiguous region. This linking idea will be central to many of the more advanced data structures, namely trees and graphs, that are coming up later in this course and in the next course in this specialization. In this module you'll also learn tools and procedures for unit testing your code, which is a way to make sure that what you've written is correct, and a staple practice of any sophisticated software developer.WEEK 4Trees! (including Binary Search Trees and Tries)Welcome to week 4! We know you've been working hard. We hope you tried that optional Markov Text Generation programming assignment last week, but if not, no worries. You can always go back and do it later (spoiler alert: it's pretty amazing that such a simple algorithm can produce such realistic text). This week there's more fun (and hard work) as we learn about trees. Trees rely on the same linked structure idea as Linked Lists, only they're MUCH faster (usually...). In the project this week you'll add auto-complete to your text editor. Believe us when we say it's so cool when you get it working! You'll see... and we bet you can't wait for the programming assignment now. :)WEEK 5Hash Maps and Edit DistanceYou made it to the last week! Congratulations on getting this far! In this last week we'll be looking at a fundamental data structure called a Hash Table. If you thought trees were fast, just wait until you see what Hash Tables can do!

We'll also give you of the unique video series we provide and help you understand how to navigate the course to get the most out of it given your background and learning speed. Finally, we'll jump right into the course programming project. We know some of you might be a little intimidated by this aspect of the course, but we'll walk you through the setup and your first assignment so you'll be having fun with it in no time. Let's get started!Objects, Memory Models, and ScopeWe hope you’re excited about the project that we're starting to build -- we sure are! In this second part of the course, we’re going to briefly step away from writing project code and learn some fundamentals of object oriented programming. Specifically, being able to trace code is a key skill in becoming a stronger programmer. This module might be a bit of a review of material you have learned in your first Java programming course. If that’s the case, you are always welcome to skip right to the end-of-week assessment, which for this week is a quiz. Also remember there are many paths you can take through the different videos:The Core videos introduce the basic material. If you learn well from lectures alone, then watching only these videos might work for you. The Concept Challenge videos test your learning of material you just watched. These videos will give you practice to make sure you’re prepared for the quizzes and the programming assignments. Most learners will find them helpful in addition to the Core video series. The Support series videos give you a little extra practice and guidance when you feel you need it. Finally, the In the Real World, and When I Struggled video series relate the concepts and skills you are learning to real-life experiences and situations. Play around with watching and/or skipping the different video types until you find a combination of that works best for your learning.WEEK 2Graphical output: Creating GUIs and Displaying DataNow that you have the tools to write and trace object oriented code, let’s get back to developing the project! In this first (real) part of the project, you will create an interactive graphical map that will display geospatial data. This is a highly interactive week, so make sure you’ve got Eclipse loaded up! We encourage you to play around as you watch the videos. Some of the code that we use in the videos is in the demos package in the starter code you set up for this course. Open it up and experiment with it while you're watching the videos. We also encourage you to dive right into the programming project, even before watching the videos, if you want. The programming assignment instructions are in the last lesson of this week - you can watch a video walkthrough of the instructions and also read the step-by-step directions in the accompanying reading. There’s lots of room for creativity, too, so have fun!WEEK 3InheritanceNow that you’re in full swing with the project, let’s take a closer look at some concepts that you have already been using in your code. Specifically, the keyword “extends”. What exactly does it mean that your program “extends PApplet”? To answer this question we’ll need to dive into the details of how Java allows for Class Hierarchies through Inheritance and Polymorphism. These fundamental and powerful concepts will serve you well in the future! We’ll use these ideas to allow for displaying markers differently. If you feel you’re already comfortable with Inheritance and Polymorphism, feel free to dive straight into the project (programming assignment) for this week. As you work with the project, feel free to have some fun and introduce new levels of class hierarchies for improved functionality.WEEK 4GUIs: Responding to User EventsYou’ve reached an exciting point in the project - in this week you’ll add interactivity to your map! You’ll be learning how to design event-driven programs, using a new and powerful programming paradigm. Your map will now respond to mouse hovers and clicks. As always, make sure you're writing code along with us as you watch the videos and work through the week. Also, feel free to dive into the programming assignment (project) whenever you are readyWEEK 5Searching and Sorting: From Code to AlgorithmsYou've come a long way in this course, and you've got a great project to show for it. In this last module we'll shift gears a bit to talk about some very exciting and fundamental algorithms for finding and sorting data in an array. Searching and sorting algorithms are not only fundamental to computer science, but also ideal for beginning to explore issues of algorithm efficiency. We will only begin to touch on issues of algorithm efficiency here. We will say much more about it in the next course in this specialization, so we hope you will continue with us. We'll also apply sorting to your project, and you'll wrap things up by finishing your project with an extension of your own choosing.WEEK 6Finishing UpWhat? Another week? Well, there's no new content to learn, but we wanted to give you a little buffer time to work on your projects and your peer review assignments and reviews. So take this time to make sure you've got the best project you can produce, and to get some ungraded feedback from your peers on your peer review assignment. Just make sure you're all finished up with your graded submission and your peer reviews well before the end of course deadline.

Well, the big problem is that the data is big—the size, complexity and diversity of datasets increases every day. This means that we need new technological or methodological solutions for analysing data. There is a great demand for people with the skills and know-how to do big data analytics.","Extract information from large datasetsThis free online course equips you for working with these solutions by introducing you to selected statistical and machine learning techniques used for analysing large datasets and extracting information.Of course, we can’t teach everything in one course, so we have focused on giving an overview of a selection of common methods. You will become familiar with predictive analysis, dimension reduction, machine learning and clustering techniques. You will also discover how simple decision trees can help us make informed decisions and you can dive into statistical learning theory.Explore real-world big data problemsThese methods will be described through case studies that explain how each is applied to solve real-world problems. You can also develop your coding skills by applying the techniques you’ve just learnt to complete hands-on tasks and obtain results.Just as there are many statistical and machine learning methods for big data analytics, there are also many software packages (see ‘Requirements’ below) that can be used for this purpose. In this course, we will expose you to three such packages, so that you can start to become familiar with using different tools, and can gain confidence in going further with these packages or using others that may come your way.",Aug 13th 2018,2 Weeks,"['Big Data', 'Statistical Inference', 'Machine Learning', 'Data Analysys']"

Development of Real-Time Systems (Coursera),https://www.mooc-list.com/go.php?courseId=4740,"This course is intended for the Master's student and computer engineer who likes practical programming and problem solving! After completing this course, you will have the knowledge to plan and set-up a real-time system both on paper and in practice.","The course centers around the problem of achieving timing correctness in embedded systems, which means to guarantee that the system reacts within the real-time requirements. Examples of such systems include airbags, emergency breaks, avionics, and also multi-media systems like video playback and QoS in web servers.The course teaches how to plan real-time systems in theory using established mathematical proofs and how to implement them in practice by using the most common scheduling methods. We also learn and how to program the system in the C language using the FreeRTOS real-time kernel. Finally we have a look at the future of real-time systems namely multi-core real-time systems!This course focus on the learn-by-doing approach with many examples and real-world programming assignments. We have 5 modules, each with a gentle graded quiz in the end and one peer reviewed programming assignment.Who is this class for: This course is intended for the Master's student and computer engineer who likes practical programming and problem solving! Note that as a consequence, quiz questions are more exam questions where you have to construct the answer based on the principles that are taught in the web lectures, rather than to recall the literal text of the teacher.SyllabusWEEK 1Introduction to Real-Time SystemsHere is where it all starts! We will make a brave attempt to start your future career in real-time systems! This week starts by learning the basic building stones in real-time systems and the system parameters required to successfully construct a real-time system. We introduce you to the corner stone of real-time systems, namely the scheduler – and its task in real-time schedules. You learn also what kind of real-time guarantees are needed in which systems. Concretely, you will learn (1) What is needed to create a real-time system (2) Where real-time requirements are needed. (3) The task and job structure and the parameters needed to schedule a task. (4) Difference between pre-emptive and non-pre-emptive tasks. This course is also part of a Blended Master Programme in Embedded Systems.Graded: Quiz 1Graded: Assignment 1WEEK 2Static SchedulingIn this week we start to actually do some scheduling. We firstly have a look at the simplest type of scheduler – the clock driven scheduler. After this we deepen our learning with the fixed priority scheduler and the monotonic schedulers. We learn how the priorities are determined using these schedulers and we learn when/when not to use these schedulers. Secondly we learn how to determine if a system is overloaded in order to validate schedules without complete system simulation.Concretely, after attending this week you will be able to: (1) Schedule a set of tasks with the clock driven scheduler, with the fixed priority scheduler, with the monotonic schedulers. (2) Determine if a system is overloaded using the total-utilization method and the Urm method. (3) Program FreeRTOS to schedule a set of tasks using the fixed priority scheduler.Graded: Quiz 2Graded: Assignment 2WEEK 3Dynamic SchedulingIn the previous week we learned the limitations of the total-utilization method and the Urm method. We start this week off by extending these tests to tasks with short response times. The new method is also, as usual, used in practice! We then focus on improving the optimality of real-time schedules. This is done by learning the principles behind dynamic scheduling methods. Two new schedulers using the dynamic scheduling principle is learned and used in practice with a few examples; the LST scheduler and the EDF scheduler.Concretely, you will learn: (1) How to determine feasibility of a set of tasks using the time demand analysis method. (2) How to schedule a set of tasks using LST and EDF. (3) To determine when a dynamic scheduler is appropriate and when it is not appropriate.Graded: Quiz 3Graded: Assignment 3WEEK 4Non-Periodic JobsAll things are easy and nice when not caring about non-periodic jobs. When including non-periodic jobs, the schedulers must take these into account to make a feasible schedule, which we learn this week. The problem is that a non-periodic job can arrive at any time, even if a periodic job is already scheduled. We learn both how to optimize a schedule for non-periodic jobs and how to validate a schedule when non-periodic jobs arrive to the schedule. Concretely, we will learn: (1) How to use the slack stealing method to optimize a schedule with non-periodic jobs (2) How to use the LRT scheduler to optimize a schedule with non-periodic jobs (3) How to use the deferrable server to optimize a schedule with non-periodic jobs (4) Formally verify a schedule with non-periodic jobs.Graded: Quiz 4Graded: Assignment 4WEEK 5Real-Time Operating SystemsThis week is what we all have been waiting for! We will deepen our learning of FreeRTOS, its kernel and the functionalities. We demonstrate the importance of predictable computer architectures for example when determining the context switch and factors influencing this overhead. As we head towards the future, we finish this course by introducing you to multi-core real-time systems and scheduling methods for multi-core real-time systems. Concretely, you will learn: (1) The internal mechanisms of FreeRTOS, for example mutexes/semaphores and message queues. (2) Multi-core computer architectures for real-time systems. (3) Multi-core scheduling methods.Graded: Quiz 5Graded: Assignment 5",Sep 2nd 2019,5 Weeks,"['Real-Time Systems', 'Programming', 'Static Scheduling', 'Dynamic Scheduling']"

Web Coding Fundamentals for Artists (kadenze),https://www.mooc-list.com/go.php?courseId=4801,"This course is an introduction to using the Web for artistic creation. It is a ""literacy"" course designed to introduce you to the various core components that make the web such a powerful platform for art – art that is not only visual, but sonic, physical, interactive, and social.","It will give you the basics (in terms of knowledge and code templates) to make things that run in browsers using:• Animation with graphics and sound,• Interaction with graphics and sound,Just as you don't need to be a mechanic to drive a car, you do not need to wait until you are an expert programmer before creating work for the web.There is a vast array of tools for making things for the web. Making things for the web is a process of constant learning and discovery – not one of knowing everything first and then making. It is also a process of ripping and mashing rather than writing everything from scratch. Getting comfortable with this process is the first step, and is the approach we take in this introductory course.By the end of this course, you will be making things with the real-world core components that give the web its potential for art, but you will have only just begun. More importantly, you will understand what you have to learn more about to accomplish your artistic objectives, be able to recognize things and be able to evaluate their value to you, and have a command of the terminology you need to search for and discuss your needs and interests with the huge community of people on the net with experience (and code chunks) to share.Why JavaScript and the Web?There are some excellent special-purpose coding platforms for artists out there such as Processing for interactive graphics, Chuck or supercollider for synthesis, graphical languages such as Max/MSP or PD for interactive sound and graphics. These platforms have extensive communities of people to share experience and code with. However, these special-purpose platforms are not standard web building and design tools.What they offer is a direct path to achieving a specific artistic objective, but it is at the expense of a more general applicability of language, tools, and skills that would allow you to interact with people in the web-based creative industries. They do a great job at ""hiding"" things you may not want to worry about as an artist, but dealing with a bit of the scaffolding is necessary if the web is the space you have chosen to embark on for developing your work.This course will take you through the basics you need to develop artistic content for the web using standard web tools – JavaScript, html, and several fundamental libraries. It will point you to exactly what concerns an artist most – making creative content. It will guide you and teach you what you can ignore for now in order to focus on artistic content, but will not prevent you from integrating with the vast world of the web and learning and using some of the scaffolding if and when you should need it later.Our basic approach to achieving this goal is to ""throw you in to the deep end"" with a set of code templates for meeting artistic goals – interactive graphical mobile applications using physical sensors, for example, and explaining simple things you can do immediately to explore and implement your own ideas.The advantages to JavaScript:• It is the language embedded in all browsers today.• It is general purpose, and makes no assumptions that limit your artistic objectives.• You can deploy all your work on the web for others to experience.• You only need to learn one language for writing both client and server code.• A *lot* of other people use it that you can share and communicate with.• It is a marketable skill.Thus, we are not restricting you to special-purpose tools that don't generalize well to the web – but that doesn't mean you will have to write a bunch of code not related to your artistic vision. The ""template"" technique used in this course is a ""middle way"" that gets you up and going fast, but provides a path to future growth and connection to the real world.You will learn to recognize patterns of code that you need not know how to write. This will provide you with a basic understanding of how things work in the real world (let's call it literacy).

Cybersecurity and Mobility (Coursera),https://www.mooc-list.com/go.php?courseId=5086,"This course is for you if you are interested in transitioning toward a managerial role in cybersecurity and mobility. Through interviews with industry experts in this area, you will learn about innovations powering the rapid spread of information technology and how they present new challenges for protecting data.","For example, mobile devices increase convenience but often bypass traditional security measures. As an upcoming manager, you will also learn how the nature of the threat evolves, as culprits employ a burgeoning set of sophisticated tools to take advantage of our growing reliance on networks for critical-data exchange.If you want to pursue a career in the public sector, the stakes are high as well. The proliferation of hackers, inevitable human errors, bring-your-own-device (BYOD) initiatives, and the ever-broadening need to share information weigh heavily on government and education organizations, and consume substantial resources. The Pentagon, for example, has proposed to spend $23 billion on network security initiatives through 2018. This sounds like a large sum, until you consider the scope and importance of the U.S. government information resources this investment must protect.Against this backdrop, this course will explain how yesterday’s prevention strategies are no longer adequate for stopping advanced, targeted attacks. Today, effective cybersecurity must be multi-dimensional and tiered, as threats can originate from virtually anywhere, target numerous levels of an organization, and sometimes persist for months or years before an information security staff is aware of an attack or breach. Therefore securing networks requires a holistic approach that incorporates several elements.Cybersecurity and Mobility is course 1 of 4 in the Cybersecurity: Developing a Program for Your Business Specialization.Cybersecurity is an essential business skill for the evolving workplace. For-profit companies, government agencies, and not-for-profit organizations all need technologically proficient, business-savvy information technology security professionals. In this Specialization, you will learn about a variety of processes for protecting business assets through policy, education and training, and technology best practices. You’ll develop an awareness of the risks and cyber threats or attacks associated with modern information usage, and explore key technical and managerial topics required for a balanced approach to information protection. Topics will include security of mobile platforms, securing the Internet of Things, security as a product of the human factor, and security governance and management practices.SyllabusWEEK 1Welcome to the Course!Welcome!

Machine Learning: Clustering & Retrieval (Coursera),https://www.mooc-list.com/go.php?courseId=5090,"Case Studies: Finding Similar Documents. A reader is interested in a specific news article and you want to find similar articles to recommend. What is the right notion of similarity? Moreover, what if there are millions of other documents? Each time you want to a retrieve a new document, do you need to search through all other documents? How do you group similar documents together? How do you discover new, emerging topics that the documents cover?","In this third case study, finding similar documents, you will examine similarity-based algorithms for retrieval. In this course, you will also examine structured representations for describing the documents in the corpus, including clustering and mixed membership models, such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). You will implement expectation maximization (EM) to learn the document clusterings, and see how to scale the methods using MapReduce.By the end of this course, you will be able to:-Create a document retrieval system using k-nearest neighbors.-Identify various similarity metrics for text data.-Reduce computations in k-nearest neighbor search by using KD-trees.-Produce approximate nearest neighbors using locality sensitive hashing.-Compare and contrast supervised and unsupervised learning tasks.-Cluster documents by topic using k-means.-Describe how to parallelize k-means using MapReduce.-Examine probabilistic clustering approaches using mixtures models.-Fit a mixture of Gaussian model using expectation maximization (EM).-Perform mixed membership modeling using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA).-Describe the steps of a Gibbs sampler and how to use its output to draw inferences.-Compare and contrast initialization techniques for non-convex optimization objectives.-Implement these techniques in Python.Course 4 of 4 in the Machine Learning Specialization.SyllabusWEEK 1WelcomeClustering and retrieval are some of the most high-impact machine learning tools out there. Retrieval is used in almost every applications and device we interact with, like in providing a set of products related to one a shopper is currently considering, or a list of people you might want to connect with on a social media platform. Clustering can be used to aid retrieval, but is a more broadly useful tool for automatically discovering structure in data, like uncovering groups of similar patients.This introduction to the course provides you with an overview of the topics we will cover and the background knowledge and resources we assume you have.WEEK 2Nearest Neighbor SearchWe start the course by considering a retrieval task of fetching a document similar to one someone is currently reading. We cast this problem as one of nearest neighbor search, which is a concept we have seen in the Foundations and Regression courses. However, here, you will take a deep dive into two critical components of the algorithms: the data representation and metric for measuring similarity between pairs of datapoints. You will examine the computational burden of the naive nearest neighbor search algorithm, and instead implement scalable alternatives using KD-trees for handling large datasets and locality sensitive hashing (LSH) for providing approximate nearest neighbors, even in high-dimensional spaces. You will explore all of these ideas on a Wikipedia dataset, comparing and contrasting the impact of the various choices you can make on the nearest neighbor results produced.Graded: Representations and metricsGraded: Choosing features and metrics for nearest neighbor searchGraded: KD-treesGraded: Locality Sensitive HashingGraded: Implementing Locality Sensitive Hashing from scratchWEEK 3Clustering with k-meansIn clustering, our goal is to group the datapoints in our dataset into disjoint sets. Motivated by our document analysis case study, you will use clustering to discover thematic groups of articles by ""topic"". These topics are not provided in this unsupervised learning task; rather, the idea is to output such cluster labels that can be post-facto associated with known topics like ""Science"", ""World News"", etc. Even without such post-facto labels, you will examine how the clustering output can provide insights into the relationships between datapoints in the dataset. The first clustering algorithm you will implement is k-means, which is the most widely used clustering algorithm out there. To scale up k-means, you will learn about the general MapReduce framework for parallelizing and distributing computations, and then how the iterates of k-means can utilize this framework. You will show that k-means can provide an interpretable grouping of Wikipedia articles when appropriately tuned.Graded: k-meansGraded: Clustering text data with K-meansGraded: MapReduce for k-meansWEEK 4Mixture ModelsIn k-means, observations are each hard-assigned to a single cluster, and these assignments are based just on the cluster centers, rather than also incorporating shape information. In our second module on clustering, you will perform probabilistic model-based clustering that provides (1) a more descriptive notion of a ""cluster"" and (2) accounts for uncertainty in assignments of datapoints to clusters via ""soft assignments"". You will explore and implement a broadly useful algorithm called expectation maximization (EM) for inferring these soft assignments, as well as the model parameters. To gain intuition, you will first consider a visually appealing image clustering task. You will then cluster Wikipedia articles, handling the high-dimensionality of the tf-idf document representation considered.Graded: EM for Gaussian mixturesGraded: Implementing EM for Gaussian mixturesGraded: Clustering text data with Gaussian mixturesWEEK 5Mixed Membership Modeling via Latent Dirichlet AllocationThe clustering model inherently assumes that data divide into disjoint sets, e.g., documents by topic. But, often our data objects are better described via memberships in a collection of sets, e.g., multiple topics. In our fourth module, you will explore latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) as an example of such a mixed membership model particularly useful in document analysis. You will interpret the output of LDA, and various ways the output can be utilized, like as a set of learned document features. The mixed membership modeling ideas you learn about through LDA for document analysis carry over to many other interesting models and applications, like social network models where people have multiple affiliations.Throughout this module, we introduce aspects of Bayesian modeling and a Bayesian inference algorithm called Gibbs sampling. You will be able to implement a Gibbs sampler for LDA by the end of the module.Graded: Latent Dirichlet AllocationGraded: Learning LDA model via Gibbs samplingGraded: Modeling text topics with Latent Dirichlet AllocationWEEK 6Hierarchical Clustering & Closing RemarksIn the conclusion of the course, we will recap what we have covered. This represents both techniques specific to clustering and retrieval, as well as foundational machine learning concepts that are more broadly useful.We provide a quick tour into an alternative clustering approach called hierarchical clustering, which you will experiment with on the Wikipedia dataset. Following this exploration, we discuss how clustering-type ideas can be applied in other areas like segmenting time series. We then briefly outline some important clustering and retrieval ideas that we did not cover in this course. We conclude with an overview of what's in store for you in the rest of the specialization.Graded: Modeling text data with a hierarchy of clusters",Sep 9th 2019,6 Weeks,"['Machine Learning Specialization', 'Machine Learning', 'Clustering', 'Retrieval', 'MapReduce', 'LDA', 'Latent Dirichlet Allocation', 'Expectation Maximization']"

"Programming Languages, Part B (Coursera)",https://www.mooc-list.com/go.php?courseId=5340,"This course is an introduction to the basic concepts of programming languages, with a strong emphasis on functional programming. The course uses the languages ML, Racket, and Ruby as vehicles for teaching the concepts, but the real intent is to teach enough about how any language “fits together” to make you more effective programming in any language -- and in learning new ones.","This course is neither particularly theoretical nor just about programming specifics -- it will give you a framework for understanding how to use language constructs effectively and how to design correct and elegant programs. By using different languages, you will learn to think more deeply than in terms of the particular syntax of one language. The emphasis on functional programming is essential for learning how to write robust, reusable, composable, and elegant programs. Indeed, many of the most important ideas in modern languages have their roots in functional programming. Get ready to learn a fresh and beautiful way to look at software and how to have fun building it.The course assumes some prior experience with programming, as described in more detail in the first module of Part A. Part B assumes successful completion of Part A.The course is divided into three Coursera courses: Part A, Part B, and Part C. As explained in more detail in the first module of Part A, the overall course is a substantial amount of challenging material, so the three-part format provides two intermediate milestones and opportunities for a pause before continuing. The three parts are designed to be completed in order and set up to motivate you to continue through to the end of Part C.Week 1 of Part A has a more detailed list of topics for all three parts of the course, but it is expected that most course participants will not (yet!) know what all these topics mean.Who is this class for: The course assumes students are familiar with programming covered by most introductory courses, but it is explicitly designed not to be a particularly advanced course. Students should be comfortable with variables, conditionals, arrays, linked lists, stacks, and recursion (though recursion will be reviewed and expanded upon), and the difference between an interface and an implementation. Students should be eager to write programs in languages new to them. Part C of the course analyzes basic object-oriented concepts and contrast them with those of other languages, so familiarity with Java or a closely related language (e.g., C#) might be helpful for Part C, but it is not necessary for the assignments. This course is based on a course designed for second- and third-year undergraduates: not a first computer science course, but not an advanced course either. So it certainly will not cover everything in the beautiful world of programming languages, but it is a solid introduction. It is designed to be eye-opening and fascinating both for learners seeking a ""third or fourth programming course"" and for learners with more experience who are looking for a clear and precise foundation in programming languages.

"Programming Languages, Part C (Coursera)",https://www.mooc-list.com/go.php?courseId=5522,"This course is an introduction to the basic concepts of programming languages, with a strong emphasis on functional programming. The course uses the languages ML, Racket, and Ruby as vehicles for teaching the concepts, but the real intent is to teach enough about how any language “fits together” to make you more effective programming in any language -- and in learning new ones.","This is Part C of a 3-part course. Participants should complete Parts A and B first -- Part C ""dives right in"" and refers often to material from Part A and Part B.This course is neither particularly theoretical nor just about programming specifics -- it will give you a framework for understanding how to use language constructs effectively and how to design correct and elegant programs. By using different languages, you will learn to think more deeply than in terms of the particular syntax of one language. The emphasis on functional programming is essential for learning how to write robust, reusable, composable, and elegant programs. Indeed, many of the most important ideas in modern languages have their roots in functional programming. Get ready to learn a fresh and beautiful way to look at software and how to have fun building it.The course assumes some prior experience with programming, as described in more detail in the first module of Part A. Part B assumes successful completion of Part A.The course is divided into three Coursera courses: Part A, Part B, and Part C. As explained in more detail in the first module of Part A, the overall course is a substantial amount of challenging material, so the three-part format provides two intermediate milestones and opportunities for a pause before continuing. The three parts are designed to be completed in order and set up to motivate you to continue through to the end of Part C.Week 1 of Part A has a more detailed list of topics for all three parts of the course, but it is expected that most course participants will not (yet!) know what all these topics mean.The course assumes students are familiar with programming covered by most introductory courses, but it is explicitly designed not to be a particularly advanced course. Students should be comfortable with variables, conditionals, arrays, linked lists, stacks, and recursion (though recursion will be reviewed and expanded upon), and the difference between an interface and an implementation. Students should be eager to write programs in languages new to them. Part C of the course analyzes basic object-oriented concepts and contrast them with those of other languages, so familiarity with Java or a closely related language (e.g., C#) might be helpful for Part C, but it is not necessary for the assignments. This course is based on a course designed for second- and third-year undergraduates: not a first computer science course, but not an advanced course either. So it certainly will not cover everything in the beautiful world of programming languages, but it is a solid introduction. It is designed to be eye-opening and fascinating both for learners seeking a ""third or fourth programming course"" and for learners with more experience who are looking for a clear and precise foundation in programming languages. The assignments in the course are designed to be challenging, but with everything you need in the course content.

Delivered by four leading research teams, it will provide you with the economic concepts, measurement approaches and data analytics to make better security and IT decisions, as well as understand the forces that shape the security decisions of other actors in the ecosystem of information goods and services.Systems often fail because the organizations that defend them do not bear the full costs of failure. In order to solve the problems of growing vulnerability to computer hackers and increasing crime, solutions must coherently allocate responsibilities and liabilities so that the parties in a position to fix problems have an incentive to do so. This requires a technical comprehension of security threats combined with an economic perspective to uncover the strategies employed by cyber hackers, attackers and defenders.The course covers five main areas:1. Introduction to key concepts in security economics. Here, we provide an overview of how information security is shaped by economic mechanisms, such as misaligned incentives, information asymmetry, and externalities.2. Measuring cybersecurity.

Analyzing Big Data with Microsoft R (edX),https://www.mooc-list.com/go.php?courseId=5894,"Learn how to use Microsoft R Server to analyze large datasets using R, one of the most powerful programming languages. The open-source programming language R has for a long time been popular (particularly in academia) for data processing and statistical analysis. Among R's strengths are that it's a succinct programming language and has an extensive repository of third party libraries for performing all kinds of analyses. Together, these two features make it possible for a data scientist to very quickly go from raw data to summaries, charts, and even full-blown reports.","However, one deficiency with R is that traditionally it uses a lot of memory, both because it needs to load a copy of the data in its entirety as a data.frame object, and also because processing the data often involves making further copies (sometimes referred to as copy-on-modify). This is one of the reasons R has been more reluctantly received by industry compared to academia.The main component of Microsoft R Server (MRS) is the RevoScaleR package, which is an R library that offers a set of functionalities for processing large datasets without having to load them all at once in the memory. RevoScaleR offers a rich set of distributed statistical and machine learning algorithms, which get added to over time. Finally, RevoScaleR also offers a mechanism by which we can take code that we developed on our laptop and deploy it on a remote server such as SQL Server or Spark (where the infrastructure is very different under the hood), with minimal effort.In this course, we will show you how to use MRS to run an analysis on a large dataset and provide some examples of how to deploy it on a Spark cluster or a SQL Server database. Upon completion, you will know how to use R for big-data problems.Since RevoScaleR is an R package, we assume that the course participants are familiar with R. A solid understanding of R data structures (vectors, matrices, lists, data frames, environments) is required. For example, students should be able to confidently tell the difference between a list and a data frame, or what each object is generally a good representation for and how to subset it. Students should be familiar with basic programming concepts such as control flows, loops, functions and scope. Students should have a good understanding of how to write and debug R functions. Finally, students are expected to have a good understanding of data manipulation and data processing in R (e.g. functions such as merge, transform, subset, cbind, rbind, lapply, apply). Familiarity with 3rd party packages such as dplyr is also helpful.This course is part of the Microsoft Professional Program Certificate in Big Data.What you'll learn:You will learn how to use MRS to read, process, and analyze large datasets including:- Read data from flat files into R’s data frame object, investigate the structure of the dataset and make corrections, and store prepared datasets for later use- Prepare and transform the data- Calculate essential summary statistics, do crosstabulation, write your own summary functions, and visualize data with the ggplot2 package- Build predictive models, evaluate and compare models, and generate predictions on new data",Self Paced,Self-Paced,"['Microsoft Professional Program in Big Data', 'Big Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Analysis', 'Microsoft R Server', 'R Language', 'R Programming']"
Observation Theory: Estimating the Unknown (edX),https://www.mooc-list.com/go.php?courseId=5896,"Learn how to estimate parameters from observational data for real-world engineering applications and assess the quality of the results. Are you an engineer, scientist or technician? Are you dealing with measurements or big data, but are you unsure about how to proceed? This is the course that teaches you how to find the best estimates of the unknown parameters from noisy observations. You will also learn how to assess the quality of your results.","TU Delft’s approach to observation theory is world leading and based on decades of experience in research and teaching in geodesy and the wider geosciences. The theory, however, can be applied to all the engineering sciences where measurements are used to estimate unknown parameters.The course introduces a standardized approach for parameter estimation, using a functional model (relating the observations to the unknown parameters) and a stochastic model (describing the quality of the observations). Using the concepts of least squares and best linear unbiased estimation (BLUE), parameters are estimated and analyzed in terms of precision and significance.The course ends with the concept of overall model test, to check the validity of the parameter estimation results using hypothesis testing. Emphasis is given to develop a standardized way to deal with estimation problems. Most of the course effort will be on examples and exercises from different engineering disciplines, especially in the domain of Earth Sciences.This course is aimed towards Engineering and Earth Sciences students at Bachelor’s, Master’s and postgraduate level.What you'll learn:- How to translate real-life estimation problems to easy mathematical models- Practical understanding of least squares estimation and best linear unbiased estimation, and how to apply these methods- How to assess and describe the quality of your estimators in the form of precision and confidence interval- How to check the validity of your estimation resultsPrerequisites:- Calculus (high school level)- Probability concepts like expectation, variance, the normal distribution and other probability density functions- Basic matrix manipulation (by hand and with e.g. Python or Matlab)Course SyllabusWeek 1: Introduction Introduction on what is “estimation” and when do we need it? What are the generic sources of uncertainty in observations, and what concepts are needed, e.g. deterministic vs. stochastic parameters, random vs. systematic errors, precision vs. accuracy, bias, and the probability distribution function as a metric of randomness. All the concepts are explained by various practical examples.Week 2: Mathematical models Learn how to develop a systematic approach to translate real-life problems into mathematical models in the form of observation-equation system including four fundamental blocks: vector of observations, vector of unknown parameters, linear (or linearized) functional relation between observations and unknowns, and stochastic characteristics of observations in the form of dispersion (or covariance matrix) of the observation vector. As well as discussion on different concepts, such as linear vs. nonlinear models, functional vs. stochastic models, consistent vs. inconsistent models, over/under –determined models, redundancy, and solvability of observation-equation systems. All the aforementioned concepts are explained by various practical examples.Week 3: Least Squares Estimation (LSE) Given a mathematical model, how to find an estimate that predicts the observations as close as possible? Introduction to (weighted) least squares estimation (WLSE), its mathematical logic and its main properties. Different applications of WLSE are demonstrated via practical examples, as well as discussion on numerical/computational aspects of applying WLSE.Week 4: Best Linear Unbiased Estimation (BLUE) How to find the most precise and accurate estimate in linear models? Introduction to the concept of Best Linear Unbiased Estimation (BLUE), its theory and implication, and its relation to other estimators such as WLSE, maximum likelihood, and minimum variance estimators. The concept of BLUE and its application in various real problems are demonstrated by examples and exercises.Week 5: How precise is the estimate? Discussion on how the uncertainty/randomness in observations (depicted by a stochastic model) propagates to the uncertainty/randomness of estimates (depicted by probability density function or covariance matrix of estimators). Introduction to the concept of error propagation and its application in specification of the uncertainty/precision of estimates, inferring confidence intervals or statistical tolerance levels of the results, and describing the expected variability of the results of an estimation. The interpretation of covariance matrices and confidence intervals is discussed and clarified via different examples and exercises.Week 6: Does the estimate make sense? Introduction to a probabilistic decision making process (or statistical hypothesis testing) in validating the results of estimation in order to avoid wrong decisions/interpretation of the results. Students learn how to verify the validity of a chosen mathematical model, and how to detect and identify model misspecifications.

This depends on the ability to communicate results to those who make decisions.,"Presenting findings to decision makers who are not familiar with the language of analytics presents a challenge. In this course you will learn how to communicate analytics results to stakeholders who do not understand the details of analytics but want evidence of analysis and data. You will be able to choose the right vehicles to present quantitative information, including those based on principles of data visualization. You will also learn how to develop and deliver data-analytics stories that provide context, insight, and interpretation.Course 4 of 5 in the Data Analytics for Business Bootcamp Specialization.SyllabusWEEK 1Introduction to the CourseIn this module we’ll briefly review the Information-Action Value Chain we introduced in Course 1. Then we’ll see how analytical techniques are applied in business problems, first by looking at some “classic” business problems that have been around for a long time, then by looking at some “emergent” business problems that have resulted from more recent advances in technology.Graded: Week 1 QuizWEEK 2Best Practices in Data VisualizationIn this module we’ll learn about a variety of visualizations used to illustrate and communicate data. We will start with the different vehicles used to present quantitative information. We will then look at a set of examples of data visualizations and discuss what makes them effective or ineffective. Finally, we discuss Excel charts and why most of them should be avoided. After completing this module, you will be able to better understand the characteristics of good data visualization and avoid common mistakes when creating your own graphs.Graded: Week 2 QuizWEEK 3Interpreting, Telling, and SellingIn this module we’ll cover a number of topics around interpreting data, gathering additional data, and pitching our recommendations based on our analysis. First, we’ll discuss ways in which we misinterpret or misrepresent data and how to avoid them, such as mistaking correlation with causation, allowing cognitive biases to influence how we see data, and visualizing data in misleading ways. We’ll also learn how experimentation can help us obtain more data, including compromises we may need to make in measurement. Finally, we’ll discuss how we communicate our results and recommendations, with a focus on knowing our audience, telling compelling stories, and creating clear and effective communication materials.Graded: Week 3 QuizWEEK 4Acting on DataIn our final module we’ll walk through two case studies and illustrate the ideas we’ve covered in the course and in the specialization as a whole. The first case shows how experimentation can be used to create data, sometimes with surprising results. The second case presents a comprehensive analysis that illustrates the entire analytic lifecycle, and shows how different methods and both quantitative and qualitative analysis can be brought together to solve one strategically important analytical problem.Graded: Week 4 QuizGraded: Final Course Assignment",Sep 9th 2019,4 Weeks,"['Business Analytics', 'Data Analysis', 'Business', 'Data Visualization', 'Data Analytics']"

Il y a des applications pour presque tout : retoucher ses photos, réserver une place de cinéma, réviser le code de la route, choisir une recette de cuisine, tourner et monter des clips vidéos, ou trouver les restaurants les plus proches.","Derrière ces applications il y a un savoir-faire spécifique à la programmation sur plateformes mobiles. En effet, contrairement aux ordinateurs classiques, les contraintes imposées par les caractéristiques ces terminaux font que certains « gestes simples » pour l'utilisateur, comme faire dérouler une liste de données, impliquent en réalité des mécanismes plus complexes.Ce MOOC est le premier d'une série de deux MOOCs consacrés à la programmation sur iPhone et iPad. Il se concentre sur le développement d'applications « mono-vues » et présente en détail les principes d'une interaction réussie de vos applications avec ses utilisateurs. Nous avons également décidé de prendre en compte les dernières nouveautés introduites dans iOS. Ainsi, ce MOOC, s'il évoque Objective-C, le langage « historique » de développement sur cette plateforme qu'il faut connaître, passera beaucoup de temps sur le nouveau langage Swift (dans sa version 3, annoncée en Septembre 2016 avec iOS10). Un parallèle avec la problématique du développement de systèmes embarqués est également fait.L'objectif, si vous suivez attentivement ce cours et réalisez les exercices proposés, est de vous rendre autonomes dans la réalisation d'applications pour l'écosystème iOS (le dernier exercice est d'ailleurs un jeu d'adresse). Vous serez aussi capables de travailler non seulement dans l'environnement de développement d'Apple mais aussi dans des environnements similaires. Les exercices sont réalisés sous iOS10, publié en septembre 2016. Nous recommandons donc l'usage de Xcode 8 ou ultérieur (accès gratuit sur le site d'Apple).Ce cours est principalement destiné à des personnes maîtrisant déjà la programmation objet. Il est dérivé d'une unité d'enseignement de 5eme année (master 2) dispensée à l'Université Pierre et Marie Curie, le premier établissement universitaire à avoir proposé en France, en 1967, un diplôme d'informatique. Il tient également compte des nombreux retours des MOOCs qui se sont déroulés en 2014 et en 2015.Si ce sujet vous intéresse, n'hésitez pas à vous inscrire et à venir nous suivre.

Big Data Analysis with Scala and Spark (Coursera),https://www.mooc-list.com/go.php?courseId=6441,"Manipulating big data distributed over a cluster using functional concepts is rampant in industry, and is arguably one of the first widespread industrial uses of functional ideas. This is evidenced by the popularity of MapReduce and Hadoop, and most recently Apache Spark, a fast, in-memory distributed collections framework written in Scala.","In this course, we'll see how the data parallel paradigm can be extended to the distributed case, using Spark throughout. We'll cover Spark's programming model in detail, being careful to understand how and when it differs from familiar programming models, like shared-memory parallel collections or sequential Scala collections. Through hands-on examples in Spark and Scala, we'll learn when important issues related to distribution like latency and network communication should be considered and how they can be addressed effectively for improved performance.Learning Outcomes. By the end of this course you will be able to:- read data from persistent storage and load it into Apache Spark,- manipulate data with Spark and Scala,- express algorithms for data analysis in a functional style,- recognize how to avoid shuffles and recomputation in Spark,Recommended background: You should have at least one year programming experience.

Is my program correct? Will it give the right output for all possible permitted inputs? Computers are now essential in everyday life. Incorrect programs lead to frustration in the best case and disaster in the worst. Thus, knowing how to construct correct programs is a skill that all who program computers must strive to master.","In this computer science course, we will presents ""goal oriented programming"" the way Edsger Dijkstra, one of the most influential computer scientists, intended. You will learn how to derive programs hand-in-hand with their proofs of correctness. The course presents a methodology that illustrates goal-oriented programming, starting with the formalization of what is to be computed, and then growing the program hand-in-hand with its proof of correctness. The methodology demonstrates that, for a broad class of matrix operations, the development, implementation, and establishment of correctness of a program can be made systematic.Since this technique focuses on program specifications, it often leads to clearer, correct programs in less time. The approach rapidly yields a family of algorithms from which you can then pick the algorithm that has desirable properties, such as attaining better performance on a given architecture.The audience of this MOOC extends beyond students and scholars interested in the domains of linear algebra algorithms and scientific computing. This course shows how to make the formal derivation of algorithms practical and will leave you pondering how our results might extend to other domains.As a result of support from MathWorks, learners will be granted access to MATLAB for the duration of the course.What you'll learn- Develop assertions describing states in a program.- Prove programs correct using logic.- Build algorithms using goal-oriented programming techniques.- “Slice and dice” to discover families of loop-based algorithms for matrix computations.",Not Available,This Course is Not Available,"['Programming', 'LAFF', 'Correctness', 'Goal-Oriented Programming']"

Cybersecurity Policy for Water and Electricity Infrastructures (Coursera),https://www.mooc-list.com/go.php?courseId=6831,"This course will examine the drinking water and electricity infrastructures, and various policies that have been developed to help guide and strengthen their cybersecurity programs. The drinking water and electricity infrastructures are two of fourteen subsectors comprising what are known as ""lifeline infrastructure"".","The 2013 National Infrastructure Protection Plan identifies four lifeline infrastructure sectors: 1) water, 2) energy, 3) transportation, and 4) communications. These sectors are designated ""lifeline"" because many other infrastructures depend upon them. The drinking water subsector is part of the water sector, and the electricity subsector is part of the energy sector. Both subsectors are overseen by the Department of Homeland Security National Protection and Programs Directorate which manages the DHS National Infrastructure Protection Program. The NIPP employs a five-step continuous improvement program called the Risk Management Framework. NIPP implementation is overseen by DHS-designated Sector-Specific Agencies staffed by various Federal departments. The Sector-Specific Agencies work in voluntary cooperation with industry representatives to apply the Risk Management Framework and document results in corresponding Sector-Specific Plans. The program began in 2007 and the most recent Sector-Specific Plans were published in 2016. In February 2013, President Obama issued Executive 13636 directing the National Institute of Standards and Technology to develop a voluntary set of recommendations for strengthening infrastructure cybersecurity measures. EO13636 also asked Federal agencies with regulating authority to make a recommendation whether the NIST Cybersecurity Framework should be made mandatory. The Environmental Protection Agency who is both the SSA and regulatory authority for the drinking water subsector recommended voluntary application of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. The Department of Energy who is both the SSA and regulatory authority for the electricity subsector replied that it was already implementing the Electricity Subsector Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model, which indeed was what the NIST Cybersecurity Framework was based on. The Department of Energy, though, recommended voluntary application of the ES-C2M2.

Homeland Security & Cybersecurity Connection - It's Not About the Terrorists (Coursera),https://www.mooc-list.com/go.php?courseId=6832,"Welcome to Course 1 in CS4950, Homeland Security and Cybersecruity. In this course we examine the origins of homeland security and its co0nnection with cybersecurity. Homeland security is about safeguarding the United States from domestic catastrophic destruction. Catastrophic destruction comes in two forms: natural and manmade.","For most of history the manmade variety came in the form of warfare and required the combined resources of a nation state. All that changed March 20th, 1995. On that date, members of a quasi-religious cult in Japan attacked the Tokyo subway system using Sarin gas. It was the first deployment of a weapon of mass destruction my a non-state actor. The power of destruction once reserved to nation states was now available to small groups, even individuals. The incident was a wake up call for governments around the world. Defense establishments designed to keep rogue states in check were practically useless against non-state actors. Overnight, the number of potential enemies multiplied a hundred, maybe even a thousand-fold. In response to the Tokyo Subway Attacks, the United States took measures to protect itself from WMD attack by non-state actors. Those measures were still being enacted when the nation was attacked on 9/11. On September 11, 2001, nineteen hijackers inflicted as much damage as the Imperial Japanese Navy on December 7, 1941. The investigating 9/11 Commission noted the attacks for their ""surpassing disproportion"". The hijackers had achieved WMD effects without using WMD. They did this by subverting the nation's transportation infrastructure, turning passenger jets into guided missiles. Again, the security implications were profound. Non-state actors seeking to inflict domestic catastrophic destruction did not need to import, fabricate, or acquire WMD as the nation was surrounded by the means of its own destruction in the form of critical infrastructure. The vulnerability of critical infrastructure had not gone unnoticed. Again, in response to the Tokyo Subway attacks, which themselves had been an attack on Japanese infrastructure, President Clinton in 1996 commissioned a panel to investigate the threat to United States' infrastructure. The panel replied in 1997 that there was no immediate threat to US infrastructure, but they were concerned with the growing risk of cyber attack. The same cyber physical systems that fueled the explosive growth of the Internet were being incorporated into Industrial Control Systems that underpinned much of the nation's critical infrastructure. The panel noted that the knowledge and skills necessary to mount a cyber attack on the nation's infrastructure was growing. As a result of this observation, President Clinton in 1998 ordered the protection of US critical infrastructure, especially from cyber attack. Following 9/11, critical infrastructure protection and cybersecurity were designated core missions in the 2002 Homeland Security Act establishing the new Department of Homeland Security. They remain core missions to this day, but many don't see the connection. The connection is this: cybersecurity is essential to critical infrastructure protection, which is essential to homeland security, which is about safeguarding the United States from domestic catastrophic destruction. I look forward to working with you in the coming lessons.

Mobile Interaction Design: How to Design Usable Mobile Products and Services (Coursera),https://www.mooc-list.com/go.php?courseId=6853,"Every mobile app gives you something. It could be not only something tangible like the pair of jeans you've ordered using the app but also a piece of work like waking you up in the morning. It could be a feeling, for instance, a feeling of enjoyment obtained from watching a video clip or a feeling of closeness flashed out after receiving an old photo from a loving person via some instant messenger.","That ""something"" is actually the reason why you use the app, it is the heart of the product, and in this course we will not talk about it. Surprised? You shouldn’t be. There are always two sides of a coin. There should be a person who makes that ""something"" accessible. It is astonishingly important because the use of the product loses its meaning if users can’t get what they want.The main objective of the course is to teach you to shape mobile products and services for people’s use. To do that, you’ll need to learn:- Interaction design activities and their place in the whole product design process- User research methods with a focus on the qualitative ones- Usability inspection and empirical usability evaluation methods- The process of design creation and best practices from interaction design, information architecture and visual design fields of study with a focus on the formerInterfaces of handheld devices and tablets are in the spotlight. However, the processes and techniques covered by the course can be successfully applied to design interactions with mobile web apps and wearables. It should be noted that this course does not cover topics such as design management and mobile development, and it will as well not teach you how to use wireframing and prototyping tools.What makes the course unique is a focus on the way of thinking during a design process, the representation of a designer’s decisions in the form of design questions that make the continuous reflection on the design process possible and leads to the growth of the number of proposed design alternatives. The second unique thing about this course is a focus on the explanation of the concept of usability problems, and the processes of discovering and analysing them.Upon completion of the course, you will be able to:- Improve designs by eliminating different kinds of interaction problems- Design huge chunks of user interfaces in the case of adding a new feature to a product- Redesign a complete app by a given set of functions (e.g., extending an existing product to a new platform)The practical part of the course will require you to discover and eliminate interaction problems of a chosen mobile app. You will go through running guerrilla usability study, analysing gathered data, and making evidence-based design changes, which will enable you to create your first case study.Who is this class for: This course was designed for those who are involved in creating digital interactive products (not necessarily for mobile) but do not have considerable experience in interaction design. If you are a UX professional in a junior position, a developer, manager or visual designer, this class is for you. This is not an introductory level course, so if you are new to the field, we recommend you take the “Introduction to User Experience Design” course from Georgia Institute of Technology before taking this one. Also, parts of this course such as the aforementioned process of design creation and approach to usability inspection can be useful for experienced designers.",Sep 9th 2019,10 Weeks,"['Mobile Design', 'Mobile Interaction Design', 'Mobile Products', 'Mobile Services', 'Design Process', 'Design', 'Product Design']"

However, the binning approach has issues, including a dependance on the number and width of the bins used to compute the histogram. One approach to overcome these issues is to fit a function to the binned data, which is known as parametric estimation. Alternatively, we can construct an approximation to the data by employing a non-parametric density estimation. The most commonly used non-parametric technique is kernel density estimation (or KDE). In this module, you will learn about density estimation and specifically how to employ KDE. One often overlooked aspect of density estimation is the model representation that is generated for the data, which can be used to emulate new data. This concept is demonstrated by applying density estimation to images of handwritten digits, and sampling from the resulting model.Graded: Module 8 Graded QuizGraded: Module 8 Programming Assignment",Sep 9th 2019,8 Weeks,"['Data Analysis', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Accountancy', 'Python', 'Probability', 'Visualization', 'Exploratory Data Analysis']"

Uno de los enfoques de esta situación es el problema de la búsqueda eficiente de información en un grupo de valores, puesto que dicha actividad es fundamental en muchos programas y una buena cantidad del tiempo de ejecución se va en localizar algo que el usuario quiere consultar. Dado este contexto, resulta muy conveniente ordenar la información que maneja el programa (objetos o valores simples) para que sea fácil de encontrar. El tema de búsqueda en particular será el que abordaremos en este módulo. Tenga en cuenta que el tiempo estimado para la realización de todas las actividades de este módulo es de cerca de 11 horas, tiempo que usted puede invertir de acuerdo con sus posibilidades. Le recomendamos que desarrolle todas las actividades en el orden propuesto y que considere hacerlo en un tiempo de dos semanas.Graded: Reto 1 Nivel básicoGraded: Evaluación teórica - OrdenamientoGraded: Evaluación Práctica - Exposición caninaWEEK 4Módulo 4: Herencia¡Le damos la bienvenida al módulo 4! Es un hecho que los programas de computador que se construyen deben evolucionar a medida que el problema y el contexto en el que éste ocurre cambian. Un programa de buena calidad es aquel que además de resolver el problema actual que se plantea, tiene una estructura que le permite evolucionar a costo razonable. No nos interesa construir un programa que tengamos que rehacer cada vez que algún aspecto del problema cambie o un nuevo requerimiento aparezca. Además de hacer evolucionar los programas a bajo costo, nos enfrentamos siempre al reto de hacer las implementaciones de la manera lo más eficiente posible (en tiempo e inversión). Para esto, lo ideal sería aprovechar otros desarrollos previos que nos ayuden en la construcción de nuestro programa. Esta es la idea del mecanismo de reutilización de clases denominado herencia, tema de este módulo. Imagínese los elevados costos si cada vez que nos lanzamos a construir un nuevo programa debemos partir desde cero. En este módulo vamos a enfrentarnos al problema de hacer implementaciones eficientes de programas: vamos a utilizar el mecanismo de herencia que nos permitirá reutilizar código de clases que ya implementamos para acelerar el tiempo que toma programar nuevas clases. A través del módulo nos familiarizaremos con los conceptos de superclases y subclases, entenderemos cómo a través de la visibilidad de los atributos y métodos podremos tener mayor o menor versatilidad al momento de implementar nuevas clases usando herencia. También explicaremos qué es una clase abstracta y sus implicaciones en el mundo del problema. Tenga en cuenta que el tiempo estimado para la realización de todas las actividades de este módulo es de cerca de 15 horas, tiempo que usted puede invertir de acuerdo con sus posibilidades. Le recomendamos que desarrolle todas las actividades en el orden propuesto y que considere hacerlo en un tiempo de dos semanas.Graded: Reto 1 Nivel básicoGraded: Evaluación teórica - HerenciaGraded: Evaluación Práctica - Extensión líneas telefónicasWEEK 5Módulo 5: Interfaz Gráfica¡Le damos la bienvenida al módulo 5! A diferencia de los módulos anteriores, en este módulo del curso, vamos a cambiar de metodología de trabajo, ya que para construir una interfaz gráfica no se necesitan grandes habilidades algorítmicas. Se trata sobre todo de entender cómo utilizar algunas clases de Java que nos permiten crear los elementos gráficos y de interacción, cómo conectarlos entre sí y cómo conectarlos con el mundo del programa. Vamos a trabajar de la siguiente manera: primero revisaremos los conceptos teóricos básicos necesarios para ir creando poco a poco los elementos que componen la interfaz gráfica, estos son: la ventana principal, los páneles, las etiquetas, las cajas de textos y los botones. Segundo, veremos cómo repartir las responsabilidades entre la interfaz gráfica y el mundo y cómo conectarlos entre sí. Y por último, veremos cómo se maneja la interacción con el usuario. Después de cada presentación teórica, usted desarrollará un ejercicio para poner en práctica los nuevos conocimientos y enfrentarse al reto de hacerlo usted mismo con la ayuda de una guía de trabajo. El punto de partida de los retos de este módulo es el mundo de la aplicación. Su misión es construir la interfaz gráfica de forma incremental, ¡reto tras reto! Tenga en cuenta que el tiempo estimado para la realización de todas las actividades de este módulo es de cerca de 9 horas, tiempo que usted puede invertir de acuerdo con sus posibilidades. Le recomendamos que desarrolle todas las actividades en el orden propuesto y que considere hacerlo en un tiempo de dos semanas.Graded: Evaluación por pares de interfaz gráfica",Sep 9th 2019,5 Weeks,"['Java', 'Programming', 'Java Programming', 'Object-Oriented Programming', 'Object-Oriented']"

What is a Proof? (Coursera),https://www.mooc-list.com/go.php?courseId=7054,"There is a perceived barrier to mathematics: proofs. In this course we will try to convince you that this barrier is more frightening than prohibitive: most proofs are easy to understand if explained correctly, and often they are even fun. We provide an accompanied excursion in the “proof zoo” showing you examples of techniques of different kind applied to different topics.","We use some puzzles as examples, not because they are “practical”, but because discussing them we learn important reasoning and problem solving techniques that are useful. We hope you enjoy playing with the puzzles and inventing/understandings the proofs.As prerequisites we assume only basic math (e.g., we expect you to know what is a square or how to add fractions), basic programming in python (functions, loops, recursion), common sense and curiosity. Our intended audience are all people that work or plan to work in IT, starting from motivated high school students.Who is this class for: Our intended audience are all people that work or plan to work in IT, starting from motivated high school students. Almost no math background is assumed.Course 1 of 5 in the Introduction to Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science SpecializationSyllabusWEEK 1Why proofs?What is a proof? Why do we care about proofs? Are the boring long tedious arguments usually known as `mathematical proofs' really needed outside the tiny circle of useless theoreticians that pray something called `mathematical rigor'? In this course we will try to show that proofs can be simple, elegant, convincing, useful and (don't laugh) exciting. Later we will try to show different proof techniques and tools, but first of all we should break the barrier and see that yes, one can understand a proof and one can enjoy the proof. We start with simple puzzles where one small remark can disclose ""what really happens there"" and then the proof becomes almost obvious.Graded: Tiles, dominos, black and white, even and oddGraded: Two Congruent PartsGraded: Pluses, Minuses and SplittingWEEK 2How to Find an Example?One example is enough to prove an existential statement, but how to find an example? In many cases the search space is enormous. A computer may help, but some reasoning that narrows the search space, is important both for computer search and for ""bare hands"" work — how can this be done? What do we need to prove if we claim that our solution is optimal? As usual, we'll practice solving many interactive puzzles. We'll show also some computer programs that help us to construct an example.Graded: Magic Square 3 times 3Graded: Different People Have Different CoinsGraded: Free accomodationGraded: Is there...Graded: Puzzle: N QueensGraded: Number of Solutions for the 8 Queens PuzzleGraded: Maximum Number of Two-digit IntegersGraded: Puzzle: Maximum Number of Rooks on a ChessboardGraded: Puzzle: Maximum Number of Knights on a ChessboardGraded: Puzzle: Maximum Number of Bishops on a ChessboardGraded: Puzzle: Subset without x and 2xWEEK 3Recursion and InductionWe'll discover two powerful methods of defining objects, proving concepts, and implementing programs — recursion and induction. These two methods are heavily used, in particular, in algorithms — for analysing correctness and running time of algorithms as well as for implementing efficient solutions. You will see that induction is as simple as falling dominos, but allows to prove complex things by decomposing them and moving step by step. You will learn how famous Gauss unexpectedly solved his teacher's problem intended to keep him busy the whole lesson in just two minutes, and in the end you will be able to prove his formula using induction. You will be able to generalize scary arithmetic exercises and then solve them easily using induction.Graded: Largest Amount that Cannot Be Paid with 5- and 7-CoinsGraded: Pay Any Large Amount with 5- and 7-CoinsGraded: Puzzle: Hanoi TowersGraded: Number of Moves to Solve the Hanoi Towers PuzzleGraded: Puzzle: Two Cells of Opposite ColorsGraded: Puzzle: Connect PointsGraded: InductionWEEK 4LogicWe have already invoked mathematical logic when we discussed proofs by examples. This week we will turn mathematical logic full on. We will discuss its basic operations and rules. We will see how logic can play a crucial and indispensable role in proofs. We will discuss how to construct a negation to the statement and we will meet the notion of a counterexamples.

Apart from being just a philosophical statement this phrase turns out to be an important idea that can actually help. In this module we will see how it can help in problem solving. Things that do not change are called invariants in mathematics. They form an important tool of proving with numerous applications, including estimating running time of algorithms. We will get some intuition of what they are, see how they can look like and get some practice in using them.Graded: Puzzle: Sums of Rows and ColumnsGraded: 'Homework Assignment' ProblemGraded: 'Homework Assignment' Problem 2Graded: Chess TournamentsGraded: Debugging ProblemGraded: Merging Bank AccountsGraded: Puzzle: Arthur's BooksGraded: Puzzle: Piece on a ChessboardGraded: Operations on Even and Odd NumbersGraded: Puzzle: Summing Up DigitsGraded: Switching SignsGraded: Recolouring ChessboardWEEK 6Solving a 15-PuzzleIn this module we consider a well known 15-puzzle where one needs to restore order among 15 square pieces in a square box. It turns out that the behavior of this puzzle is determined by mathematics: it is solvable if and only if the corresponding permutation is even. We learn the basic properties of even and odd permutations. The task is to write a program that determines whether a permutation is even or odd.

Digital Dividends: Strengthening the Analog Foundation of the Digital Revolution (edX),https://www.mooc-list.com/go.php?courseId=7420,"From the World Development Report (WDR) 2016, learn what the internet and related digital technologies can do for your family, business, city and country. Using a variety of learning tools and methodologies, this course will help you understand the role that the internet plays in economic development, and in the lives of people and businesses in general.","Traditional development challenges are preventing the digital revolution from fulfilling its transformative potential: the opportunity to bring broader development gains in the form of faster growth, more jobs and better services to economies.In this course, you’ll explore answers to the following key questions: What are the challenges that prevent digital dividends from spreading more rapidly? What are the most important returns to digital investments? What should be done to fully benefit from the digital revolution?The course will benefit a broad variety of audiences, ranging from student to policymaker, and from entrepreneur to civic actor.What you'll learn- National priorities and policies related to the ICT sector and the way other sectors can fully benefit from the internet & digital technologies;- How to prioritize policies for countries at different stages of digital development;- What are the key issues and challenges that countries have on their way to development powered by digitalization;- How countries can fully benefit from digital dividends.Course SyllabusWeek 1: Overview: How the internet promotes developmentThe Module Overview sets the stage for the five weeks that follow. It introduces economic and social impact of digital revolution and analyzes a broad range of issues on productivity, inequality, and liberty in the digital age. It draws on the work done in the 2016 World Development Report: Digital Dividends. Module One introduces the concept collectively referred to as the “Digital dividends”: faster growth, more jobs and better services. It analyzes the impact from the perspective of three agents: business, people and government. The Module argues that there are factors beyond technology that shape their development impact. The report calls them the “Analog foundations” of the digital revolution. The module concludes that, in absence of those analog complements, the benefits will often fall short.Week 2: Accelerating growth: More trade, higher productivity and greater competitionThe Module 2 is based on chapter 1 of the WDR 2016 and introduces participants to a framework for the internet and economic growth. It discusses how trade, productivity and competition are enhanced by digital technology. It points out that digital technology creates opportunities to accelerate growth as it reduces transaction costs. This allows firms to enter new markets, enhance their efficiency and exploit economies of scale, leading to innovation. The module raises an issue of competition and argues that firms that face more competition use digital technology more intensively and effectively, because it enables them to reduce their costs to outperform their competitors. The module concludes that: 1) The opportunities are often missed because ﬁrms in sectors where technology’s impact is greatest are frequently protected from innovative competitors, and 2) Regulation to foster competition in the digital economy must prevent anticompetitive behavior and ensure that potential entrepreneurs have fair market access.This module focuses specifically on two sectors: Agriculture, and Digital Finance.Week 3: Expanding opportunities: Creating jobs and boosting labor productivity Module 3 is based on chapter 2 of the WDR 2016 and focuses on new opportunities that digital technologies generate for employment and earnings. It also examines the risks involved. It discusses how digital technologies can create jobs and increase earnings, as well as increase worker productivity; while at the same time beneﬁting consumers. The module also argues that a major risk associated with introduction of digital technologies is related to the speed of labor market changes and the destruction of jobs. The module demonstrates how by improving internet access, basic literacy, and providing education opportunities via skill and training systems, countries can realize significant benefits that will be broadly shared. The most crucial element is skill development. Two sets of skills are increasingly important in today’s labor markets: Information and Communication Technology (ICT) skills and higher-order cognitive and socioemotional skills. The module suggests that without complementary policies, many beneﬁts can go unrealized and inequality can increase. The module focuses on Education and Jobs, and discusses how digital technologies help empower women, both economically and socially.Week 4: Delivering services: Connecting for a capable and accountable government Module 4 is based on chapter 3 of the WDR 2016 and focuses on how digital technologies can strengthen government capability and empower citizens. The module outlines how this is done through three mechanisms: 1) overcoming information barriers and promoting participation by citizens in services and in elections; 2) enabling governments to replace some factors used for producing services through the automation of routine activities; and, 3) enabling citizens to connect with one another; fostering citizen voice and collective action. The module analyzes the impact of these mechanisms on capability and empowerment, which depend upon the strength of government institutions. The module concludes that the misalignment between digital technologies and weak or unaccountable institutions creates twin risks: increasing elite control paired with the wasting of scarce public resources on ineffective e-government projects. The module focuses on e-Health and Identification for Development (ID4D).Week 5: Policy implications: Making the internet universal, affordable and safe Module 5 is based on chapter 4 of the report. It examines policy challenges for digital development, and defines next generation policies for increasing connectivity and expanding digital dividends to all communities. It defines supply-side (availability, accessibility and affordability) and demand-side (open and safe internet use) policies. Government policies and regulation of the internet help shape the digital economy. The module focuses on key policy ingredients that include market competition, private participation, and independent regulation. Independent regulation requires establishing ICT regulatory agencies that are independent of leading operators and of government departments. The module concludes that, particularly through their policies for the ICT sector, governments and regulatory agencies create an enabling environment for the private sector to build networks, develop services, and provide content and applications for users. The module focuses on Data Revolution, Smart Cities and Cyber Security.Week 6: National priorities: Making the Internet work for everyone Module 6 is based on chapter 5 of the WDR 2016 and examines the need of governments to focus on digital technology in their national plans. It presents evidence that developing or transitioning countries can seize the opportunities the internet offers by implementing a smart and comprehensive digital development strategy. The module cautions that ICT projects often fail when they focus solely on technology - without also addressing shortcomings in the complements that cannot be automated. The module suggests that successful digital strategies need to focus on two pillars: one digital and the other analog. If digital investments are not accompanied by improvements in the analog complements, countries face significant risks. The module focuses on Energy and Six Digital technologies to watch.At the end of the Module 6, a summary of conclusions for the course is presented.",Nov 7th 2017,6 Weeks,"['Digital Revolution', 'Digital Technology', 'Internet', 'Digital Dividends']"

This course provides a framework to analyze these concerns as you examine the ethical and privacy implications of collecting and managing big data.","Explore the broader impact of the data science field on modern society and the principles of fairness, accountability and transparency as you gain a deeper understanding of the importance of a shared set of ethical values. You will examine the need for voluntary disclosure when leveraging metadata to inform basic algorithms and/or complex artificial intelligence systems while also learning best practices for responsible data management, understanding the significance of the Fair Information Practices Principles Act and the laws concerning the ""right to be forgotten.""This course will help you answer questions such as who owns data, how do we value privacy, how to receive informed consent and what it means to be fair.Data scientists and anyone beginning to use or expand their use of data will benefit from this course. No particular previous knowledge needed.SyllabusWEEK 1What are Ethics?Module 1 of this course establishes a basic foundation in the notion of simple utilitarian ethics we use for this course. The lecture material and the quiz questions are designed to get most people to come to an agreement about right and wrong, using the utilitarian framework taught here. If you bring your own moral sense to bear, or think hard about possible counter-arguments, it is likely that you can arrive at a different conclusion. But that discussion is not what this course is about. So resist that temptation, so that we can jointly lay a common foundation for the rest of this course.Graded: Module 1 QuizHistory, Concept of Informed ConsentEarly experiments on human subjects were by scientists intent on advancing medicine, to the benefit of all humanity, disregard for welfare of individual human subjects. Often these were performed by white scientists, on black subject. In this module we will talk about the laws that govern the Principle of Informed Consent. We will also discuss why informed consent doesn’t work well for retrospective studies, or for the customers of electronic businesses.Graded: Module 2 QuizData OwnershipWho owns data about you? We'll explore that question in this module. A few examples of personal data include copyrights for biographies; ownership of photos posted online, Yelp, Trip Advisor, public data capture, and data sale. We'll also explore the limits on recording and use of data.Graded: Module 3 QuizWEEK 2PrivacyPrivacy is a basic human need. Privacy means the ability to control information about yourself, not necessarily the ability to hide things. We have seen the rise different value systems with regards to privacy. Kids today are more likely to share personal information on social media, for example. So while values are changing, this doesn’t remove the fundamental need to be able to control personal information. In this module we'll examine the relationship between the services we are provided and the data we provide in exchange: for example, the location for a cell phone. We'll also compare and contrast ""data"" against ""metadata"".Graded: Module 4 QuizAnonymityCertain transactions can be performed anonymously. But many cannot, including where there is physical delivery of product. Two examples related to anonymous transactions we'll look at are ""block chains"" and ""bitcoin"". We'll also look at some of the drawbacks that come with anonymity.Graded: Module 5 QuizWEEK 3Data ValidityData validity is not a new concern. All too often, we see the inappropriate use of Data Science methods leading to erroneous conclusions. This module points out common errors, in language suited for a student with limited exposure to statistics. We'll focus on the notion of representative sample: opinionated customers, for example, are not necessarily representative of all customers.Graded: Module 6 QuizAlgorithmic FairnessWhat could be fairer than a data-driven analysis? Surely the dumb computer cannot harbor prejudice or stereotypes. While indeed the analysis technique may be completely neutral, given the assumptions, the model, the training data, and so forth, all of these boundary conditions are set by humans, who may reflect their biases in the analysis result, possibly without even intending to do so. Only recently have people begun to think about how algorithmic decisions can be unfair. Consider this article, published in the New York Times. This module discusses this cutting edge issue.Graded: Module 7 QuizWEEK 4Societal ConsequencesIn Module 8, we consider societal consequences of Data Science that we should be concerned about even if there are no issues with fairness, validity, anonymity, privacy, ownership or human subjects research. These “systemic” concerns are often the hardest to address, yet just as important as other issues discussed before. For example, we consider ossification, or the tendency of algorithmic methods to learn and codify the current state of the world and thereby make it harder to change. Information asymmetry has long been exploited for the advantage of some, to the disadvantage of others. Information technology makes spread of information easier, and hence generally decreases asymmetry. However, Big Data sets and sophisticated analyses increase asymmetry in favor of those with ability to acquire/access.Graded: Module 8 QuizCode of EthicsFinally, in Module 9, we tie all the issues we have considered together into a simple, two-point code of ethics for the practitioner.Graded: Module 9 QuizGraded: Data Ethics Case StudyAttributionsThis module contains lists of attributions for the external audio-visual resources used throughout the course.",Sep 2nd 2019,4 Weeks,"['Data Science', 'Ethics', 'Privacy', 'Data Privacy', 'Data Validity']"

Data is everywhere, from the media to the health sciences, and from financial forecasting to engineering design. It drives our decisions, and shapes our views and beliefs. But how can we make sense of it? This course introduces some of the key ideas and concepts of statistics, the discipline that allows us to analyse and interpret the data that underpins modern society.","In this course, you will explore the key principles of statistics for yourself, using interactive applets, and you will learn to interpret and evaluate the data you encounter in everyday life.No previous knowledge of statistics is required, although familiarity with secondary school mathematics is advisable.What you'll learnAfter completing this course, you’ll be able to:- Understand the key principles of statistics;- Interpret and evaluate the kinds of data found in everyday life;- Perform, and interpret results from, simple statistical analyses.Course SyllabusWeek 1: Introducing Data What is statistics? We begin the course with this question, and see how data lies at the heart of statistics. We look at common techniques for presenting and summarising data.Week 2: Patterns in DataWe look further into the science of data analysis, focusing on finding and interpreting relationships between different data sets, and on using trends in data to make predictions.Week 3: Collecting Data We look at key methods of data collection, seeing how we generally use samples of a population to make predictions about the whole population. We learn about how to choose a representative sample, and how to set up a statistical experiment. Week 4: Uncertainty in DataUsing samples to make predictions about a population brings uncertainty into our data. As the study of risk and uncertainty, probability is therefore key to understanding statistics. We build up the knowledge and understanding needed to study deeper statistical methods.Week 5: Understanding UncertaintyWe apply the ideas about uncertainty that we have learnt in real-life situations in order to gain an understanding of data and the systems that generate it.Week 6: Statistical TestingWe introduce the testing method that is fundamental to all of science: the hypothesis test. We learn how to set up and perform a hypothesis test, and look at how such tests are used in scientific research.",Jan 10th 2018,8 Weeks,"['Statistics', 'Data Analysis']"

Genome Assembly Programming Challenge (Coursera),https://www.mooc-list.com/go.php?courseId=7686,"In Spring 2011, thousands of people in Germany were hospitalized with a deadly disease that started as food poisoning with bloody diarrhea and often led to kidney failure. It was the beginning of the deadliest outbreak in recent history, caused by a mysterious bacterial strain that we will refer to as E. coli X. Soon, German officials linked the outbreak to a restaurant in Lübeck, where nearly 20% of the patrons had developed bloody diarrhea in a single week. At this point, biologists knew that they were facing a previously unknown pathogen and that traditional methods would not suffice – computational biologists would be needed to assemble and analyze the genome of the newly emerged pathogen.","To investigate the evolutionary origin and pathogenic potential of the outbreak strain, researchers started a crowdsourced research program. They released bacterial DNA sequencing data from one of a patient, which elicited a burst of analyses carried out by computational biologists on four continents.The 2011 German outbreak represented an early example of epidemiologists collaborating with computational biologists to stop an outbreak. In this Genome Assembly Programming Challenge, you will follow in the footsteps of the bioinformaticians investigating the outbreak by developing a program to assemble the genome of the E. coli X from millions of overlapping substrings of the E.coli X genome.Course 6 of 6 in the Data Structures and Algorithms SpecializationSyllabusWEEK 1The 2011 European E. coli OutbreakIn April 2011, hundreds of people in Germany were hospitalized with a deadly disease that often started as food poisoning with bloody diarrhea. It was the beginning of the deadliest outbreak in recent history, caused by a mysterious bacterial strain that we will refer to as E. coli X. Within a few months, the outbreak had infected thousands and killed 53 people. To prevent the further spread of the outbreak, computational biologists all over the world had to answer the question “What is the genome sequence of E. coli X?” in order to figure out what new genes it acquired to become pathogenic. The 2011 German outbreak represented an early example of epidemiologists collaborating with computational biologists to stop an outbreak. In this Genome Assembly Programming Challenge, you will follow in the footsteps of the bioinformaticians investigating the outbreak by developing a program to assemble the genome of the deadly E. coli X strain. However, before you embark on building a program for assembling the E. coli X strain, we have to explain some genomic concepts and warm you up by having you solve a simpler problem of assembling a small virus.WEEK 2Assembling Genomes Using de Bruijn GraphsDNA sequencing approach that led to assembly of a small virus in 1977 went through a series of transformations that contributed to the emergence of personalized medicine a few years ago. By the late 1980s, biologists were routinely sequencing viral genomes containing hundreds of thousands of nucleotides, but the idea of sequencing a bacterial (let alone the human) genome containing millions (or even billions) of nucleotides remained preposterous and would cost billions of dollars. In 1988, three biologists (independently and simultaneously!) came up with an idea to reduce sequencing cost and proposed the futuristic and at the time completely implausible method of DNA arrays. None of these three biologists could have possibly imagined that the implications of his own experimental research would eventually bring him face-to-face with challenging algorithmic problems. In this module you will learn about the algorithmic challenge of DNA sequencing using information about short k-mers provided by DNA arrays. You will also travel to the 18the century to learn about the Bridges of Konigsberg and solve a related problem of assembling a jigsaw puzzle!WEEK 3Genome Assembly Faces Real Sequencing DataOur discussion of genome assembly has thus far relied upon various assumptions. In this module, we will face practical challenges introduced by quirks in modern sequencing technologies and discuss some algorithmic techniques that have been devised to address these challenges. Afterwards, you will assemble the smallest bacterial genome that lives symbiotically inside leafhoppers. Its sheltered life has allowed it to reduce its genome to only about 112,091 nucleotides and 137 genes.

"Algorithms, Part I (Coursera)",https://www.mooc-list.com/go.php?courseId=77,"This course covers the essential information that every serious programmer needs to know about algorithms and data structures, with emphasis on applications and scientific performance analysis of Java implementations. Part I covers basic iterable data types, sorting, and searching algorithms.","Suggested Readings:SyllabusWEEK 1Course IntroductionWelcome to Algorithms, Part I.Union−FindWe illustrate our basic approach to developing and analyzing algorithms by considering the dynamic connectivity problem. We introduce the union−find data type and consider several implementations (quick find, quick union, weighted quick union, and weighted quick union with path compression). Finally, we apply the union−find data type to the percolation problem from physical chemistry.Graded: PercolationAnalysis of AlgorithmsThe basis of our approach for analyzing the performance of algorithms is the scientific method. We begin by performing computational experiments to measure the running times of our programs. We use these measurements to develop hypotheses about performance. Next, we create mathematical models to explain their behavior. Finally, we consider analyzing the memory usage of our Java programs.WEEK 2Stacks and QueuesWe consider two fundamental data types for storing collections of objects: the stack and the queue. We implement each using either a singly-linked list or a resizing array. We introduce two advanced Java features—generics and iterators—that simplify client code. Finally, we consider various applications of stacks and queues ranging from parsing arithmetic expressions to simulating queueing systems.Graded: Deques and Randomized QueuesElementary SortsWe introduce the sorting problem and Java's Comparable interface. We study two elementary sorting methods (selection sort and insertion sort) and a variation of one of them (shellsort). We also consider two algorithms for uniformly shuffling an array. We conclude with an application of sorting to computing the convex hull via the Graham scan algorithm.WEEK 3MergesortWe study the mergesort algorithm and show that it guarantees to sort any array of n items with at most n lg n compares. We also consider a nonrecursive, bottom-up version. We prove that any compare-based sorting algorithm must make at least n lg n compares in the worst case. We discuss using different orderings for the objects that we are sorting and the related concept of stability.Graded: Collinear PointsQuicksortWe introduce and implement the randomized quicksort algorithm and analyze its performance. We also consider randomized quickselect, a quicksort variant which finds the kth smallest item in linear time. Finally, we consider 3-way quicksort, a variant of quicksort that works especially well in the presence of duplicate keys.WEEK 4Priority QueuesWe introduce the priority queue data type and an efficient implementation using the binary heap data structure. This implementation also leads to an efficient sorting algorithm known as heapsort. We conclude with an applications of priority queues where we simulate the motion of n particles subject to the laws of elastic collision.Graded: 8 PuzzleElementary Symbol TablesWe define an API for symbol tables (also known as associative arrays) and describe two elementary implementations using a sorted array (binary search) and an unordered list (sequential search). When the keys are Comparable, we define an extended API that includes the additional methods min, max floor, ceiling, rank, and select. To develop an efficient implementation of this API, we study the binary search tree data structure and analyze its performance.WEEK 5Balanced Search TreesIn this lecture, our goal is to develop a symbol table with guaranteed logarithmic performance for search and insert (and many other operations). We begin with 2−3 trees, which are easy to analyze but hard to implement. Next, we consider red−black binary search trees, which we view as a novel way to implement 2−3 trees as binary search trees. Finally, we introduce B-trees, a generalization of 2−3 trees that are widely used to implement file systems.Geometric Applications of BSTsWe start with 1d and 2d range searching, where the goal is to find all points in a given 1d or 2d interval. To accomplish this, we consider kd-trees, a natural generalization of BSTs when the keys are points in the plane (or higher dimensions). We also consider intersection problems, where the goal is to find all intersections among a set of line segments or rectangles.Graded: Kd-TreesWEEK 6Hash TablesWe begin by describing the desirable properties of hash function and how to implement them in Java, including a fundamental tenet known as the uniform hashing assumption that underlies the potential success of a hashing application. Then, we consider two strategies for implementing hash tables—separate chaining and linear probing. Both strategies yield constant-time performance for search and insert under the uniform hashing assumption.Symbol Table ApplicationsWe consider various applications of symbol tables including sets, dictionary clients, indexing clients, and sparse vectors.",Sep 2nd 2019,6 Weeks,"['Algorithms', 'Data Structures', 'Java', 'Programming']"

This course will increase learners’ understanding of social media by looking at the ways networked connectivity let users become 'social', how this was amplified with the emergence of the web, and how social media became the default mode of the mobile web we use today.What you'll learnBy completing this course, you should be able to:- Map significant milestones in the emergence of social media- Differentiate between 'Web 2.0' and participatory culture- Understand the differences in the way users and social media companies utilise and think about social media- Extrapolate current social trends online and map possible directions in social media.Course SyllabusModule 1: Social Media before the Web Examines social tools, protocols and ways of communicating that developed in the first two decades of the internet, and the surprising dominance of social communication using networks that were initially designed for very different purposes.- The internet’s first ‘killer app’: email- Newsgroups and BBS Bulletin Boards- The emergence of online communities- Aliases, avatars and pseudonyms: identity experimentation.Module 2: Web 2.0 and Participatory Culture Examines the explosion of networked interaction after the emergence of the World Wide Web in the 1990s, through to the most well-known early examples of social media: blogs and wikis.- Blogs: the democratisation of publication- Wikis: participatory culture, collective intelligence and the emergence of the Wikipedia- 'Web 2.0' and the selling of social media- The emergence of social presence: you are your web presence.Module 3: Social Platforms Examines the way that the dominant social media platforms took centre stage, and how these spaces made social media a normal part of everyday life and changed political communication.- Facebook: how people became profiles- Twitter: how 140 characters became the new politics- Google’s YouTube: social meets video, and the challenges of building communities on ever-expanding platforms- The ‘real name’ web: the push to make online and offline identities the same.Module 4: Social Goes Everywhere: The Mobile Web Examines the way social media changes when phones and tablets let users be online at every moment, in every place and space, and how devices, not just people, start to send social signals.- Snapchat and Instagram: mobile, visual and the communication that deletes-by-default- Locative media: how places are augmented by a social layer- Wearables: FitBits and trackers as social media- Owning big data: are users a source of big data, and how might that be used?",Jan 29th 2018,4 Weeks,"['Social Media', 'Online Communication', 'Communication', 'Web', 'Web 2.0', 'Social Platforms']"
Algorithmic Design and Techniques (edX),https://www.mooc-list.com/go.php?courseId=7758,"Learn how to design algorithms, solve computational problems and implement solutions efficiently.","In this course, part of the Algorithms and Data Structures MicroMasters program, you will learn basic algorithmic techniques and ideas for computational problems, which arise in practical applications such as sorting and searching, divide and conquer, greedy algorithms and dynamic programming.This course will cover theories, including:- how to sort data and how it helps for searching;- how to break a large problem into pieces and solve them recursively;- when it makes sense to proceed greedily;- how dynamic programming is used in genomic studies.You will practice solving computational problems, designing new algorithms, and implementing solutions efficiently (so that they run in less than a second).What you'll learn- Essential algorithmic techniques - greedy algorithms, divide and conquer, binary search, sorting, dynamic programming- Best practices of implementing algorithms efficiently- Ways of testing and debugging programsCourse SyllabusModule 1: WelcomeHere we will provide an overview of where algorithms and data structures are used (hint: everywhere) and walk you through a few sample programming challenges. The programming challenges represent an important (and often the most difficult!) part of this specialization because the only way to fully understand an algorithm is to implement it. Writing correct and efficient programs is hard; please don’t be surprised if they don’t work as you planned—our first programs did not work either! We will help you on your journey through the specialization by showing how to implement your first programming challenges. We will also introduce testing techniques that will help increase your chances of passing assignments on your first attempt. In case your program does not work as intended, we will show how to fix it, even if you don’t yet know which test your implementation is failing on.Module 2: IntroductionIn this module you will learn that programs based on efficient algorithms can solve the same problem billions of times faster than programs based on naïve algorithms. You will learn how to estimate the running time and memory of an algorithm without even implementing it. Armed with this knowledge, you will be able to compare various algorithms, select the most efficient ones, and finally implement them as our programming challenges!Module 3: Greedy AlgorithmsIn this module you will learn about seemingly naïve yet powerful class of algorithms called greedy algorithms. After you will learn the key idea behind the greedy algorithms, you may feel that they represent the algorithmic Swiss army knife that can be applied to solve nearly all programming challenges in this course. But be warned: with a few exceptions that we will cover, this intuitive idea rarely works in practice! For this reason, it is important to prove that a greedy algorithm always produces an optimal solution before using this algorithm. In the end of this module, we will test your intuition and taste for greedy algorithms by offering several programming challenges.Module 4: Divide-and-ConquerIn this module you will learn about a powerful algorithmic technique called Divide and Conquer. Based on this technique, you will see how to search huge databases millions of times faster than using naïve linear search. You will even learn that the standard way to multiply numbers (that you learned in the grade school) is far from the being the fastest! We will then apply the divide-and-conquer technique to design two efficient algorithms (merge sort and quick sort) for sorting huge lists, a problem that finds many applications in practice. Finally, we will show that these two algorithms are optimal, that is, no algorithm can sort faster!Modules 5 and 6: Dynamic ProgrammingIn this final module of the course you will learn about the powerful algorithmic technique for solving many optimization problems called Dynamic Programming. It turned out that dynamic programming can solve many problems that evade all attempts to solve them using greedy or divide-and-conquer strategy. There are countless applications of dynamic programming in practice: from maximizing the advertisement revenue of a TV station, to search for similar Internet pages, to gene finding (the problem where biologists need to find the minimum number of mutations to transform one gene into another). You will learn how the same idea helps to automatically make spelling corrections and to show the differences between two versions of the same text.",Self Paced,Self-Paced,"['Algorithms and Data Structures MicroMasters', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Algorithmic Techniques', 'Dynamic Programming']"

Foundations of Data Science: Prediction and Machine Learning (edX),https://www.mooc-list.com/go.php?courseId=8052,"Learn how to use machine learning, with a focus on regression and classification, to automatically identify patterns in your data and make better predictions. One of the principal responsibilities of a data scientist is to make reliable predictions based on data. When the amount of data available is enormous, it helps if some of the analysis can be automated. Machine learning is a way of identifying patterns in data and using them to automatically make predictions or decisions in the future. In this data science course, you will learn how basic concepts and elements of machine learning.","The two main methods of machine learning you will learn are regression and classification. Regression is used when you seek to predict a numerical quantity. Classification is used when you seek to choose which category to assign (e.g., given information about a financial transaction, predict whether it is fraudulent or legitimate).For regression, we will teach you how to measure the correlation between two variables and compute a best-fit line for making predictions when the underlying relationship is linear. We will also teach you how to quantify the uncertainty in your prediction using the bootstrap method. These techniques will be illustrated with a wide range of examples. For classification, you will learn the k-nearest neighbor classification algorithm, learn how to measure the effectiveness of your classifier, and learn how to apply it to real-world tasks.The course will highlight the assumptions underlying the techniques, and will provide ways to assess whether those assumptions are good.

Using real-world examples from law, medicine and football, you’ll discover how data scientists make conclusions about unknowns based on the data available. Often, the data we have is incomplete, yet we’d still like to draw inferences about the world and quantify the uncertainty in our conclusions. This is called statistical inference. In this course, you will learn methods for statistical inference and see how to apply them to real-world data sets.","The course will teach you estimation: given a random sample, estimate some quantity that we cannot observe directly. You will also learn how to quantify the uncertainty in your estimate. Second, the course will teach you about hypothesis testing, which allows us to evaluate theories or hypotheses about how the world works. In hypothesis testing, we compare what the theory would predict to the actual observations and data we have, to determine whether the theory appears to be consistent with the available data. You will also learn how to quantify the uncertainty in the conclusions you draw using hypothesis testing. This helps assess whether patterns that appear to be present in the data actually represent a true relationship in the world or whether they might merely reflect random fluctuations due to noise. You will learn multiple methods for estimation and hypothesis testing, based on simulation, the bootstrap method, and A/B testing for comparing two random samples.

Upon completing, you will be able to recognize NLP tasks in your day-to-day work, propose approaches, and judge what techniques are likely to work well.","The final project is devoted to one of the most hot topics in today’s NLP. You will build your own conversational chat-bot that will assist with search on StackOverflow website. The project will be based on practical assignments of the course, that will give you hands-on experience with such tasks as text classification, named entities recognition, and duplicates detection.Throughout the lectures, we will aim at finding a balance between traditional and deep learning techniques in NLP and cover them in parallel. For example, we will discuss word alignment models in machine translation and see how similar it is to attention mechanism in encoder-decoder neural networks. Core techniques are not treated as black boxes. On the contrary, you will get in-depth understanding of what’s happening inside. To succeed in that, we expect your familiarity with the basics of linear algebra and probability theory, machine learning setup, and deep neural networks. Some materials are based on one-month-old papers and introduce you to the very state-of-the-art in NLP research.Who is this class for: This course is for those who are interested in NLP field and want to know the current state-of-the-art in research and production. We expect that you have already taken some courses on machine learning and deep learning, but probably have never applied those models to texts and want to get a quick start.Course 4 of 7 in the Advanced Machine Learning Specialization.SyllabusWEEK 1Intro and text classificationIn this module we will have two parts: first, a broad overview of NLP area and our course goals, and second, a text classification task. It is probably the most popular task that you would deal with in real life. It could be news flows classification, sentiment analysis, spam filtering, etc. You will learn how to go from raw texts to predicted classes both with traditional methods (e.g. linear classifiers) and deep learning techniques (e.g. Convolutional Neural Nets).Graded: Classical text miningGraded: Predict tags on StackOverflow with linear modelsGraded: Simple neural networks for textWEEK 2Language modeling and sequence taggingIn this module we will treat texts as sequences of words. You will learn how to predict next words given some previous words. This task is called language modeling and it is used for suggests in search, machine translation, chat-bots, etc. Also you will learn how to predict a sequence of tags for a sequence of words. It could be used to determine part-of-speech tags, named entities or any other tags, e.g. ORIG and DEST in ""flights from Moscow to Zurich"" query. We will cover methods based on probabilistic graphical models and deep learning.Graded: Language modelingGraded: Sequence tagging with probabilistic modelsGraded: Recognize named entities on Twitter with LSTMsWEEK 3Vector Space Models of SemanticsThis module is devoted to a higher abstraction for texts: we will learn vectors that represent meanings. First, we will discuss traditional models of distributional semantics. They are based on a very intuitive idea: ""you shall know the word by the company it keeps"". Second, we will cover modern tools for word and sentence embeddings, such as word2vec, FastText, StarSpace, etc. Finally, we will discuss how to embed the whole documents with topic models and how these models can be used for search and data exploration.Graded: Word and sentence embeddingsGraded: Find duplicate questions on StackOverflow by their embeddingsGraded: Topic ModelsWEEK 4Sequence to sequence tasksNearly any task in NLP can be formulates as a sequence to sequence task: machine translation, summarization, question answering, and many more.

Python. Functional Programming (Stepik),https://www.mooc-list.com/go.php?courseId=8147,"The course is about functional elements available in Python and their usage. Functional programming is a programming paradigm -- that is, a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs in some distinct way.","In some sense, any programming style may be characterized by the way that abstractions are built within that style. For example, the widespread Object Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm is about building data-based abstractions, making ""smart data"" in a way, treating the computation as a process of interactions within a system of complex entities called objects. Functional programming is about building procedure-based abstractions, treating the computation as a chain of evaluations of functions. These functions are somewhat close to the mathematical ones. Code written in functional manner emphasizes reliability, reusability, abstractness.A style of designing a program is essentially a style of designing solutions for problems. If you are not familiar with the functional manner of problem solving, exploring it can teach you a lot of patterns, approaches, and tools for program design. You should be warned, however, that no particular approach may be thought of as ""the silver bullet"". But you can still successively combine various techniques, including functional programming techniques, to approach better results.I invite you to discover the basic tools that will allow you to implement some of the functional programming techniques in a popular multi-paradigm language called Python. Though Python is more inclined towards Object Oriented Programming, it still is a multi-paradigm language and writing some elements of the code in a functional manner may sometimes give a considerable amount of advantages and it is possible if desired.Recommend BackgroundYou should be familiar with the basics of Python programming (variables, data types, if-else statements, loops, functions, exception handling, objects, methods and properties).

Everything has a beginning and everything must be built from the ground up. This holds true even when it comes to software engineering and programming languages. Data structures provide a grounding for programming language and hold data and codes that determine what action will trigger what reaction.","Data structures and Algorithms are two important concepts when it comes to learning any programming language, functional or object oriented, from the ground up. In order to master a language, you must first master the basic groundwork for that language.Data structures such as lists, trees, maps, etc. represent underlying data and are often required to be sorted and merged, transformed and matched in some way. To do this manually, it would require a lot of time and man power, which is where algorithms play a crucial role. Software engineers have created algorithms that provide a solution for this task, which is consistent, repeatable and testable with a set of metrics to quantify performance.For your system to work without a hitch, your data structures must be perform perfectly, which means that your algorithms should be accurate and designed for efficiency.

This simplifies the process of sorting and processes data faster and more efficiently.AWS EC2 instance offers a wide selection of instances that have been designed to fit different types of scenarios, one of which includes sorting and processing of big data sets. Instance types comprise different combinations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity and gives you the flexibility to choose your preferred mix of resources for your applications.Data isn't always found in a systematic manner that is easy to sort and filter. It is often a huge ball of mess, and trying to look for something in this data can be as difficult as trying to look for a needle in a haystack.However, don't fret! There are many solutions these days to help you not only sort this data, but also systematically find trends and patterns to better understand and make reliable decisions. Data is ever-growing and as more and more people add to the growing database online, data grows. Hadoop and Amazon AWS EC2, are two epic solutions to helping sort and tame big data.In this course, you will learn:- Concepts of Big Data- Setting up of Environment for running Hadoop- Learn Setting up of Amazon EC2 instance- Introduction to Hadoop- Installation and Configuration of Hadoop- Hadoop core components- HDFS architecture & Map Reduce, including hands on with both the technologies- Installation and Configuration of Apache Pig and HiveSo, what are you waiting for?

You no longer have to scour through many different resources to learn it. If you are a beginner or an expert, this course has something for everybody.So, what is OOP PHP and why is it the talk of the town?Object-oriented programming is based around objects rather than actions, which means the developer manipulates the object itself, rather than the logic required to manipulate them. In this sense, items that are similar or require constantly calling would be clubbed as one object, which would further have classes and sub classes. So, if the developer wants to modify or call all of the items under this object, instead of doing it individually and constantly repeating the code, he would only need to modify the main object and with it all the items clubbed under it would also be modified. Make sense now?Although originally shying away from it, PHP finally embraced OOP in 2004, with the release of PHP5. PHP, being a server-side programming language, is already very intimidating without the help of OOP and this is why this course was specifically designed. The course objective is to break down PHP coding basics, how it works with OOP and slowly takes you on the journey to becoming a master PHP programmer.The course covers simple concepts such as classes, objects, methods, properties, the MVC, MySQL, Data Binding, Data Abstraction, etc. From fundamentals, you will graduate on to the advanced concepts and finally using all that you have learned – you will actually build an application with a complete login/registration system.This course will cover the following:- What is OOP and how does it tie in with PHP- Basic OOP fundamentals, along with basic PHP concepts- Advanced OOP concepts- How to create a database class to work with MySQL- How to build an application using OOP, complete with a login/registration systemThis course is your one-stop-shop for all OOP PHP needs.
